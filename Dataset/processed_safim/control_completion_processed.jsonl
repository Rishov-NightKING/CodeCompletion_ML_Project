{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Stanley lives in a country that consists of $$$n$$$ cities (he lives in city $$$1$$$). There are bidirectional roads between some of the cities, and you know how long it takes to ride through each of them. Additionally, there is a flight between each pair of cities, the flight between cities $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ takes $$$(u - v)^2$$$ time.Stanley is quite afraid of flying because of watching \"Sully: Miracle on the Hudson\" recently, so he can take at most $$$k$$$ flights. Stanley wants to know the minimum time of a journey to each of the $$$n$$$ cities from the city $$$1$$$.\n\nInput Specification: In the first line of input there are three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 20$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cities, the number of roads, and the maximal number of flights Stanley can take. The following $$$m$$$ lines describe the roads. Each contains three integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$, $$$1 \\leq w \\leq 10^{9}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the cities the road connects and the time it takes to ride through. Note that some pairs of cities may be connected by more than one road.\n\nOutput Specification: Print $$$n$$$ integers, $$$i$$$-th of which is equal to the minimum time of traveling to city $$$i$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first sample, it takes no time to get to city 1; to get to city 2 it is possible to use a flight between 1 and 2, which will take 1 unit of time; to city 3 you can get via a road from city 1, which will take 1 unit of time. In the second sample, it also takes no time to get to city 1. To get to city 2 Stanley should use a flight between 1 and 2, which will take 1 unit of time.

There are $$$n$$$ cities in Italy indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ directed roads indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. Initially, Keshi is located in the city $$$1$$$ and wants to go to AmShZ's house in the city $$$n$$$. Since Keshi doesn't know the map of Italy, AmShZ helps him to see each other as soon as possible.In the beginning of each day, AmShZ can send one of the following two messages to Keshi: AmShZ sends the index of one road to Keshi as a blocked road. Then Keshi will understand that he should never use that road and he will remain in his current city for the day. AmShZ tells Keshi to move. Then, Keshi will randomly choose one of the cities reachable from his current city and move there. (city $$$B$$$ is reachable from city $$$A$$$ if there's an out-going road from city $$$A$$$ to city $$$B$$$ which hasn't become blocked yet). If there are no such cities, Keshi will remain in his current city.Note that AmShZ always knows Keshi's current location.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You are given $$$n$$$ points on the plane, the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point are $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$. No two points have the same coordinates.The distance between points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ is defined as $$$d(i,j) = |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|$$$.For each point, you have to choose a color, represented by an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. For every ordered triple of different points $$$(a,b,c)$$$, the following constraints should be met:  if $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ have the same color, then $$$d(a,b) = d(a,c) = d(b,c)$$$;  if $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same color, and the color of $$$c$$$ is different from the color of $$$a$$$, then $$$d(a,b) &lt; d(a,c)$$$ and $$$d(a,b) &lt; d(b,c)$$$. Calculate the number of different ways to choose the colors that meet these constraints.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points. Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^8$$$). No two points have the same coordinates (i.\u2009e. if $$$i \\ne j$$$, then either $$$x_i \\ne x_j$$$ or $$$y_i \\ne y_j$$$).\n\nOutput Specification: Print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of ways to choose the colors for the points. Since it can be large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first test, the following ways to choose the colors are suitable:  $$$[1, 1, 1]$$$;  $$$[2, 2, 2]$$$;  $$$[3, 3, 3]$$$;  $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$;  $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$;  $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$;  $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$;  $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$;  $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$.

There is no better partition so the answer is $$$7$$$.\n\nCode:\n\ndef read():\r\n    return int(input())\r\n\r\ndef readline():\r\n    return list(map(int,input().split()))\r\n\r\ndef solve():\r\n    n=read()\r\n    arr=readline()\r\n    ans,cur=0,0\r\n    a,suma=-1,0\r\n    b,sumb=n,0\r\n    while True:\r\n        if a>=b: break\r\n        elif suma>sumb:\r\n            b-=1\r\n            sumb+=arr[b]\r\n            cur+=1\r\n        elif # TODO: Your code here\r\n            a+=1\r\n            suma+=arr[a]\r\n            cur+=1\r\n        else :\r\n            ans=cur\r\n            a+=1\r\n            b-=1\r\n            suma+=arr[a]\r\n            sumb+=arr[b]\r\n            cur+=2\r\n    print(ans)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    T=read()\r\n    for i in range(T):\r\n        solve()", "eval_prompt": "def read():\r\n    return int(input())\r\n\r\ndef readline():\r\n    return list(map(int,input().split()))\r\n\r\ndef solve():\r\n    n=read()\r\n    arr=readline()\r\n    ans,cur=0,0\r\n    a,suma=-1,0\r\n    b,sumb=n,0\r\n    while True:\r\n        if a>=b: break\r\n        elif suma>sumb:\r\n            b-=1\r\n            sumb+=arr[b]\r\n            cur+=1\r\n        elif {{completion}}\r\n            a+=1\r\n            suma+=arr[a]\r\n            cur+=1\r\n        else :\r\n            ans=cur\r\n            a+=1\r\n            b-=1\r\n            suma+=arr[a]\r\n            sumb+=arr[b]\r\n            cur+=2\r\n    print(ans)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    T=read()\r\n    for i in range(T):\r\n        solve()", "ground_truth": "suma<sumb:", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"4\\n3\\n10 20 10\\n6\\n2 1 4 2 4 1\\n5\\n1 2 4 8 16\\n9\\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11 8 10\", \"output\": [\"2\\n6\\n0\\n7\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_000795", "full_ground_truth": "def read():\r\n    return int(input())\r\n\r\ndef readline():\r\n    return list(map(int,input().split()))\r\n\r\ndef solve():\r\n    n=read()\r\n    arr=readline()\r\n    ans,cur=0,0\r\n    a,suma=-1,0\r\n    b,sumb=n,0\r\n    while True:\r\n        if a>=b: break\r\n        elif suma>sumb:\r\n            b-=1\r\n            sumb+=arr[b]\r\n            cur+=1\r\n        elif suma<sumb:\r\n            a+=1\r\n            suma+=arr[a]\r\n            cur+=1\r\n        else :\r\n            ans=cur\r\n            a+=1\r\n            b-=1\r\n            suma+=arr[a]\r\n            sumb+=arr[b]\r\n            cur+=2\r\n    print(ans)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    T=read()\r\n    for i in range(T):\r\n        solve()"}

The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Today, like every year at SWERC, the $$$n^2$$$ contestants have gathered outside the venue to take a drone photo. Jennifer, the social media manager for the event, has arranged them into an $$$n\\times n$$$ square. Being very good at her job, she knows that the contestant standing on the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row with the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$a_{i,j}$$$ years old. Coincidentally, she notices that no two contestants have the same age, and that everyone is between $$$1$$$ and $$$n^2$$$ years old.Jennifer is planning to have some contestants hold a banner with the ICPC logo parallel to the ground, so that it is clearly visible in the aerial picture. Here are the steps that she is going to follow in order to take the perfect SWERC drone photo.  First of all, Jennifer is going to select four contestants standing on the vertices of an axis-aligned rectangle.  Then, she will have the two younger contestants hold one of the poles, while the two older contestants will hold the other pole.  Finally, she will unfold the banner, using the poles to support its two ends. Obviously, this can only be done if the two poles are parallel and do not cross, as shown in the pictures below.    Being very indecisive, Jennifer would like to try out all possible arrangements for the banner, but she is worried that this may cause the contestants to be late for the competition. How many different ways are there to choose the four contestants holding the poles in order to take a perfect photo? Two choices are considered different if at least one contestant is included in one but not the other.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n \\le 1500$$$). The next $$$n$$$ lines describe the ages of the contestants. Specifically, the $$$i$$$-th line contains the integers $$$a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\\ldots,a_{i,n}$$$ ($$$1\\le a_{i,j}\\le n^2$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$a_{i,j}\\neq a_{k,l}$$$ if $$$i\\neq k$$$ or $$$j\\neq l$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print the number of ways for Jennifer to choose the four contestants holding the poles.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first sample, there are $$$4$$$ contestants, arranged as follows.   There is only one way to choose four contestants, with one pole held by contestants aged $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ and the other one by contestants aged $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$. But then, as we can see in the picture, the poles cross.   Since there is no valid way to choose four contestants, the answer is $$$0$$$.In the second sample, the $$$4$$$ contestants are arranged as follows.

Jennifer, the social media manager for the event, has arranged them into an $$$n\\times n$$$ square. Being very good at her job, she knows that the contestant standing on the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row with the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$a_{i,j}$$$ years old. Coincidentally, she notices that no two contestants have the same age, and that everyone is between $$$1$$$ and $$$n^2$$$ years old.Jennifer is planning to have some contestants hold a banner with the ICPC logo parallel to the ground, so that it is clearly visible in the aerial picture. Here are the steps that she is going to follow in order to take the perfect SWERC drone photo.  First of all, Jennifer is going to select four contestants standing on the vertices of an axis-aligned rectangle.  Then, she will have the two younger contestants hold one of the poles, while the two older contestants will hold the other pole.  Finally, she will unfold the banner, using the poles to support its two ends. Obviously, this can only be done if the two poles are parallel and do not cross, as shown in the pictures below.    Being very indecisive, Jennifer would like to try out all possible arrangements for the banner, but she is worried that this may cause the contestants to be late for the competition. How many different ways are there to choose the four contestants holding the poles in order to take a perfect photo? Two choices are considered different if at least one contestant is included in one but not the other.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n \\le 1500$$$). The next $$$n$$$ lines describe the ages of the contestants. Specifically, the $$$i$$$-th line contains the integers $$$a_{i,1},a_{i,2},\\ldots,a_{i,n}$$$ ($$$1\\le a_{i,j}\\le n^2$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$a_{i,j}\\neq a_{k,l}$$$ if $$$i\\neq k$$$ or $$$j\\neq l$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print the number of ways for Jennifer to choose the four contestants holding the poles.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first sample, there are $$$4$$$ contestants, arranged as follows.   There is only one way to choose four contestants, with one pole held by contestants aged $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ and the other one by contestants aged $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$.

Since there is no valid way to choose four contestants, the answer is $$$0$$$.In the second sample, the $$$4$$$ contestants are arranged as follows.   Once again, there is only one way to choose four contestants, but this time the poles don't cross.

Your task is to move along the touch-line, namely the side of the field, always looking very carefully at the match to check for offside positions and other offences.Football is an extremely serious matter in Italy, and thus it is fundamental that you keep very close track of the ball for as much time as possible. This means that you want to maximise the number of kicks which you monitor closely. You are able to monitor closely a kick if, when it happens, you are in the position along the touch-line with minimum distance from the place where the kick happens.Fortunately, expert analysts have been able to accurately predict all the kicks which will occur during the game. That is, you have been given two lists of integers, $$$t_1, \\ldots, t_n$$$ and $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$, indicating that $$$t_i$$$ seconds after the beginning of the match the ball will be kicked and you can monitor closely such kick if you are at the position $$$a_i$$$ along the touch-line. At the beginning of the game you start at position $$$0$$$ and the maximum speed at which you can walk along the touch-line is $$$v$$$ units per second (i.e., you can change your position by at most $$$v$$$ each second).

Determine if it can be solved, i.e., if there is a path which goes from the center to the outside of the maze which does not touch any wall. The maze is described by $$$n$$$ walls. Each wall can be either circular or straight.   Circular walls are described by a radius $$$r$$$, the distance from the center, and two angles $$$\\theta_1, \\theta_2$$$ describing the beginning and the end of the wall in the clockwise direction. Notice that swapping the two angles changes the wall.  Straight walls are described by an angle $$$\\theta$$$, the direction of the wall, and two radii $$$r_1 &lt; r_2$$$ describing the beginning and the end of the wall. Angles are measured in degrees; the angle $$$0$$$ corresponds to the upward pointing direction; and angles increase clockwise (hence the east direction corresponds to the angle $$$90$$$).\n\nInput Specification: Each test contains multiple test cases.

It also turned out that there are no spaces in this language: a sentence is written by just concatenating its words into a single string.Alina has found one such sentence $$$s$$$ and she is curious: is it possible that it consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$?In other words, determine, if it's possible to concatenate these $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words in some order so that the resulting string is $$$s$$$. Each of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words must be used exactly once in the concatenation, but you can choose the order in which they are concatenated.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

Notice that the condition $$$|s|=a+b+2c+2d$$$ (here $$$|s|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$s$$$) is equivalent to the fact that $$$s$$$ is as long as the concatenation of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words.

It also turned out that there are no spaces in this language: a sentence is written by just concatenating its words into a single string.Alina has found one such sentence $$$s$$$ and she is curious: is it possible that it consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$?In other words, determine, if it's possible to concatenate these $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words in some order so that the resulting string is $$$s$$$.

It also turned out that there are no spaces in this language: a sentence is written by just concatenating its words into a single string.Alina has found one such sentence $$$s$$$ and she is curious: is it possible that it consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$?In other words, determine, if it's possible to concatenate these $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words in some order so that the resulting string is $$$s$$$. Each of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words must be used exactly once in the concatenation, but you can choose the order in which they are concatenated.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ ($$$0\\le a,b,c,d\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of times that words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$ respectively must be used in the sentence. The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$s$$$ consists only of the characters $$$\\texttt{A}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$1\\le |s| \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$|s|=a+b+2c+2d$$$) \u00a0\u2014 the sentence. Notice that the condition $$$|s|=a+b+2c+2d$$$ (here $$$|s|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$s$$$) is equivalent to the fact that $$$s$$$ is as long as the concatenation of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words. The sum of the lengths of $$$s$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if it is possible that the sentence $$$s$$$ consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{B}$$$. Clearly, it can't consist of a single word $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, so the answer is $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$.In the second test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of a single word $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, so the answer is $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$.In the third test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{ABAB}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, and one word $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\texttt{A} + \\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{B} = \\texttt{ABAB}$$$.In the fourth test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{ABAAB}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and one word $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\texttt{A} + \\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{AB} = \\texttt{ABAAB}$$$. In the fifth test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{BAABBABBAA}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, two words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and two words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{AB} + \\texttt{B} + \\texttt{AB} + \\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{A}= \\texttt{BAABBABBAA}$$$.\n\nCode:\n\ndef solve():\r\n    cnt_a, cnt_b, cnt_ab, cnt_ba = map(int, input().strip().split())\r\n    # print(cntA, cntB, cntAB, cntBA)\r\n    s = input()\r\n    if s.count('A') != cnt_a + cnt_ba + cnt_ab:\r\n        print(\"NO\")\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    stk = [[1, s[0]]]\r\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\r\n        if i == 0:\r\n            continue\r\n        c = s[i]\r\n        if c != stk[-1][1]:\r\n            x = stk.pop()\r\n            stk.append([x[0] + 1, c])\r\n        else:\r\n            stk.append([1, c])\r\n    stk.sort()\r\n    rest = 0\r\n    for cnt, last in stk:\r\n        # print(cnt, last)\r\n        if not cnt % 2:\r\n            if # TODO: Your code here\r\n                cnt_ba -= cnt >> 1\r\n            elif last == 'B' and cnt_ab >= (cnt >> 1):\r\n                cnt_ab -= cnt >> 1\r\n            else:\r\n                rest += (cnt >> 1) - 1\r\n        else:\r\n            rest += cnt >> 1\r\n    # print(rest, cnt_ab, cnt_ba)\r\n    if rest >= cnt_ab + cnt_ba:\r\n        print(\"YES\")\r\n    else:\r\n        print(\"NO\")\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    t = int(input())\r\n    for _ in range(t):\r\n        solve()\r\n", "eval_prompt": "def solve():\r\n    cnt_a, cnt_b, cnt_ab, cnt_ba = map(int, input().strip().split())\r\n    # print(cntA, cntB, cntAB, cntBA)\r\n    s = input()\r\n    if s.count('A') != cnt_a + cnt_ba + cnt_ab:\r\n        print(\"NO\")\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    stk = [[1, s[0]]]\r\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\r\n        if i == 0:\r\n            continue\r\n        c = s[i]\r\n        if c != stk[-1][1]:\r\n            x = stk.pop()\r\n            stk.append([x[0] + 1, c])\r\n        else:\r\n            stk.append([1, c])\r\n    stk.sort()\r\n    rest = 0\r\n    for cnt, last in stk:\r\n        # print(cnt, last)\r\n        if not cnt % 2:\r\n            if {{completion}}\r\n                cnt_ba -= cnt >> 1\r\n            elif last == 'B' and cnt_ab >= (cnt >> 1):\r\n                cnt_ab -= cnt >> 1\r\n            else:\r\n                rest += (cnt >> 1) - 1\r\n        else:\r\n            rest += cnt >> 1\r\n    # print(rest, cnt_ab, cnt_ba)\r\n    if rest >= cnt_ab + cnt_ba:\r\n        print(\"YES\")\r\n    else:\r\n        print(\"NO\")\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    t = int(input())\r\n    for _ in range(t):\r\n        solve()\r\n", "ground_truth": "last == 'A' and cnt_ba >= (cnt >> 1):", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"8\\n1 0 0 0\\nB\\n0 0 1 0\\nAB\\n1 1 0 1\\nABAB\\n1 0 1 1\\nABAAB\\n1 1 2 2\\nBAABBABBAA\\n1 1 2 3\\nABABABBAABAB\\n2 3 5 4\\nAABAABBABAAABABBABBBABB\\n1 3 3 10\\nBBABABABABBBABABABABABABAABABA\", \"output\": [\"NO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO\\nYES\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_001190", "full_ground_truth": "def solve():\r\n    cnt_a, cnt_b, cnt_ab, cnt_ba = map(int, input().strip().split())\r\n    # print(cntA, cntB, cntAB, cntBA)\r\n    s = input()\r\n    if s.count('A') != cnt_a + cnt_ba + cnt_ab:\r\n        print(\"NO\")\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    stk = [[1, s[0]]]\r\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\r\n        if i == 0:\r\n            continue\r\n        c = s[i]\r\n        if c != stk[-1][1]:\r\n            x = stk.pop()\r\n            stk.append([x[0] + 1, c])\r\n        else:\r\n            stk.append([1, c])\r\n    stk.sort()\r\n    rest = 0\r\n    for cnt, last in stk:\r\n        # print(cnt, last)\r\n        if not cnt % 2:\r\n            if last == 'A' and cnt_ba >= (cnt >> 1):\r\n                cnt_ba -= cnt >> 1\r\n            elif last == 'B' and cnt_ab >= (cnt >> 1):\r\n                cnt_ab -= cnt >> 1\r\n            else:\r\n                rest += (cnt >> 1) - 1\r\n        else:\r\n            rest += cnt >> 1\r\n    # print(rest, cnt_ab, cnt_ba)\r\n    if rest >= cnt_ab + cnt_ba:\r\n        print(\"YES\")\r\n    else:\r\n        print(\"NO\")\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    t = int(input())\r\n    for _ in range(t):\r\n        solve()\r\n"}

The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) \u00a0\u2014 the size of the permutation. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) \u00a0\u2014 the elements of the permutation. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case output a single integer \u00a0\u2014 the largest possible number of odd subarrays that you can get after splitting the permutation into several consecutive subarrays.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first and third test cases, no matter how we split our permutation, there won't be any odd subarrays.In the second test case, we can split our permutation into subarrays $$$[4, 3], [2, 1]$$$, both of which are odd since their numbers of inversions are $$$1$$$.In the fourth test case, we can split our permutation into a single subarray $$$[2, 1]$$$, which is odd.In the fifth test case, we can split our permutation into subarrays $$$[4, 5], [6, 1, 2, 3]$$$. The first subarray has $$$0$$$ inversions, and the second has $$$3$$$, so it is odd.\n\nCode:\n\nimport fileinput\r\n\r\nlines = []\r\n\r\nfor line in fileinput.input():\r\n    line_f = [int(x) for x in line.split()]\r\n    if len(line_f) > 0:\r\n        lines.append(line_f)\r\n    # print ffs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\r\n    n = lines[i][0]\r\n    a = lines[i+1]\r\n\r\n    numoddseg = 0\r\n    prev = -1\r\n    i = 0\r\n    while i < n:\r\n        if # TODO: Your code here\r\n            numoddseg += 1\r\n            prev = -1\r\n        else:\r\n            prev = a[i]\r\n        i += 1\r\n\r\n    print(numoddseg)\r\n    ", "eval_prompt": "import fileinput\r\n\r\nlines = []\r\n\r\nfor line in fileinput.input():\r\n    line_f = [int(x) for x in line.split()]\r\n    if len(line_f) > 0:\r\n        lines.append(line_f)\r\n    # print ffs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\r\n    n = lines[i][0]\r\n    a = lines[i+1]\r\n\r\n    numoddseg = 0\r\n    prev = -1\r\n    i = 0\r\n    while i < n:\r\n        if {{completion}}\r\n            numoddseg += 1\r\n            prev = -1\r\n        else:\r\n            prev = a[i]\r\n        i += 1\r\n\r\n    print(numoddseg)\r\n    ", "ground_truth": "a[i] < prev:", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"5\\n\\n3\\n\\n1 2 3\\n\\n4\\n\\n4 3 2 1\\n\\n2\\n\\n1 2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2 1\\n\\n6\\n\\n4 5 6 1 2 3\", \"output\": [\"0\\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_001260", "full_ground_truth": "import fileinput\r\n\r\nlines = []\r\n\r\nfor line in fileinput.input():\r\n    line_f = [int(x) for x in line.split()]\r\n    if len(line_f) > 0:\r\n        lines.append(line_f)\r\n    # print ffs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor i in range(1, len(lines), 2):\r\n    n = lines[i][0]\r\n    a = lines[i+1]\r\n\r\n    numoddseg = 0\r\n    prev = -1\r\n    i = 0\r\n    while i < n:\r\n        if a[i] < prev:\r\n            numoddseg += 1\r\n            prev = -1\r\n        else:\r\n            prev = a[i]\r\n        i += 1\r\n\r\n    print(numoddseg)\r\n    "}

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You found a map of a weirdly shaped labyrinth. The map is a grid, consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. The rows of the grid are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from bottom to top. The columns of the grid are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right.The labyrinth has $$$n$$$ layers. The first layer is the bottom left corner (cell $$$(1, 1)$$$). The second layer consists of all cells that are in the grid and adjacent to the first layer by a side or a corner. The third layer consists of all cells that are in the grid and adjacent to the second layer by a side or a corner. And so on. The labyrinth with $$$5$$$ layers, for example, is shaped as follows:   The layers are separated from one another with walls. However, there are doors in these walls.Each layer (except for layer $$$n$$$) has exactly two doors to the next layer. One door is placed on the top wall of the layer and another door is placed on the right wall of the layer. For each layer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ you are given positions of these two doors. The doors can be passed in both directions: either from layer $$$i$$$ to layer $$$i+1$$$ or from layer $$$i+1$$$ to layer $$$i$$$.If you are standing in some cell, you can move to an adjacent by a side cell if a wall doesn't block your move (e.g. you can't move to a cell in another layer if there is no door between the cells).Now you have $$$m$$$ queries of sort: what's the minimum number of moves one has to make to go from cell $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to cell $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of layers in the labyrinth. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains four integers $$$d_{1,x}, d_{1,y}, d_{2,x}$$$ and $$$d_{2,y}$$$ ($$$1 \\le d_{1,x}, d_{1,y}, d_{2,x}, d_{2,y} \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the doors. Both cells are on the $$$i$$$-th layer. The first cell is adjacent to the top wall of the $$$i$$$-th layer by a side\u00a0\u2014 that side is where the door is. The second cell is adjacent to the right wall of the $$$i$$$-th layer by a side\u00a0\u2014 that side is where the door is. The next line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries. The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains four integers $$$x_1, y_1, x_2$$$ and $$$y_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the cells in the $$$j$$$-th query.\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of moves one has to make to go from cell $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to cell $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteHere is the map of the labyrinth from the second example.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You found a map of a weirdly shaped labyrinth. The map is a grid, consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. The rows of the grid are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from bottom to top. The columns of the grid are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right.The labyrinth has $$$n$$$ layers. The first layer is the bottom left corner (cell $$$(1, 1)$$$). The second layer consists of all cells that are in the grid and adjacent to the first layer by a side or a corner. The third layer consists of all cells that are in the grid and adjacent to the second layer by a side or a corner. And so on. The labyrinth with $$$5$$$ layers, for example, is shaped as follows:   The layers are separated from one another with walls. However, there are doors in these walls.Each layer (except for layer $$$n$$$) has exactly two doors to the next layer. One door is placed on the top wall of the layer and another door is placed on the right wall of the layer. For each layer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ you are given positions of these two doors. The doors can be passed in both directions: either from layer $$$i$$$ to layer $$$i+1$$$ or from layer $$$i+1$$$ to layer $$$i$$$.If you are standing in some cell, you can move to an adjacent by a side cell if a wall doesn't block your move (e.g. you can't move to a cell in another layer if there is no door between the cells).Now you have $$$m$$$ queries of sort: what's the minimum number of moves one has to make to go from cell $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to cell $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of layers in the labyrinth. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains four integers $$$d_{1,x}, d_{1,y}, d_{2,x}$$$ and $$$d_{2,y}$$$ ($$$1 \\le d_{1,x}, d_{1,y}, d_{2,x}, d_{2,y} \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the doors. Both cells are on the $$$i$$$-th layer. The first cell is adjacent to the top wall of the $$$i$$$-th layer by a side\u00a0\u2014 that side is where the door is. The second cell is adjacent to the right wall of the $$$i$$$-th layer by a side\u00a0\u2014 that side is where the door is. The next line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries. The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains four integers $$$x_1, y_1, x_2$$$ and $$$y_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the cells in the $$$j$$$-th query.\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of moves one has to make to go from cell $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to cell $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteHere is the map of the labyrinth from the second example.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You found a map of a weirdly shaped labyrinth. The map is a grid, consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. The rows of the grid are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from bottom to top. The columns of the grid are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right.The labyrinth has $$$n$$$ layers. The first layer is the bottom left corner (cell $$$(1, 1)$$$). The second layer consists of all cells that are in the grid and adjacent to the first layer by a side or a corner. The third layer consists of all cells that are in the grid and adjacent to the second layer by a side or a corner. And so on. The labyrinth with $$$5$$$ layers, for example, is shaped as follows:   The layers are separated from one another with walls. However, there are doors in these walls.Each layer (except for layer $$$n$$$) has exactly two doors to the next layer. One door is placed on the top wall of the layer and another door is placed on the right wall of the layer. For each layer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ you are given positions of these two doors. The doors can be passed in both directions: either from layer $$$i$$$ to layer $$$i+1$$$ or from layer $$$i+1$$$ to layer $$$i$$$.If you are standing in some cell, you can move to an adjacent by a side cell if a wall doesn't block your move (e.g. you can't move to a cell in another layer if there is no door between the cells).Now you have $$$m$$$ queries of sort: what's the minimum number of moves one has to make to go from cell $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to cell $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of layers in the labyrinth. The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains four integers $$$d_{1,x}, d_{1,y}, d_{2,x}$$$ and $$$d_{2,y}$$$ ($$$1 \\le d_{1,x}, d_{1,y}, d_{2,x}, d_{2,y} \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the doors. Both cells are on the $$$i$$$-th layer. The first cell is adjacent to the top wall of the $$$i$$$-th layer by a side\u00a0\u2014 that side is where the door is. The second cell is adjacent to the right wall of the $$$i$$$-th layer by a side\u00a0\u2014 that side is where the door is. The next line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries. The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains four integers $$$x_1, y_1, x_2$$$ and $$$y_2$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the cells in the $$$j$$$-th query.\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of moves one has to make to go from cell $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ to cell $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteHere is the map of the labyrinth from the second example.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Consider an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers.You may perform the following operation:   select two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$), then  decrease all elements $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\dots, a_r$$$ by $$$1$$$. Let's call $$$f(a)$$$ the minimum number of operations needed to change array $$$a$$$ into an array of $$$n$$$ zeros.Determine if for all permutations$$$^\\dagger$$$ $$$b$$$ of $$$a$$$, $$$f(a) \\leq f(b)$$$ is true. $$$^\\dagger$$$ An array $$$b$$$ is a permutation of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ consists of the elements of $$$a$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[4,2,3,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$[3,2,4,4]$$$ while $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation of $$$[1,2,3]$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 description of the array $$$a$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: This is a hard version of the problem. The only difference between an easy and a hard version is in the number of queries.Polycarp grew a tree from $$$n$$$ vertices. We remind you that a tree of $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n-1$$$ edges that does not contain cycles.He calls a set of vertices passable if there is such a path in the tree that passes through each vertex of this set without passing through any edge twice. The path can visit other vertices (not from this set).In other words, a set of vertices is called passable if there is a simple path that passes through all the vertices of this set (and possibly some other).For example, for a tree below sets $$$\\{3, 2, 5\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 5, 4\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 4\\}$$$ are passable, and $$$\\{1, 3, 5\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$$$ are not.  Polycarp asks you to answer $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is a set of vertices. For each query, you need to determine whether the corresponding set of vertices is passable.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 number of vertices. Following $$$n - 1$$$ lines a description of the tree.. Each line contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\ne v$$$) \u2014 indices of vertices connected by an edge. Following line contains single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 number of queries. The following $$$2 \\cdot q$$$ lines contain descriptions of sets. The first line of the description contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) \u2014 the size of the set. The second line of the description contains $$$k$$$ of distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) \u2014 indices of the vertices of the set. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ values for all queries does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Output $$$q$$$ lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding query. As an answer, output \"YES\" if the set is passable, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\nCode:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom decimal import *\r\nfrom heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush\r\nimport math\r\nimport random\r\nimport string\r\nfrom copy import deepcopy\r\nfrom itertools import combinations, permutations, product\r\nfrom operator import mul, itemgetter\r\nfrom functools import reduce, lru_cache\r\nfrom bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right\r\n\r\ndef input():\r\n    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\r\ndef getN():\r\n    return int(input())\r\ndef getNM():\r\n    return map(int, input().split())\r\ndef getList():\r\n    return list(map(int, input().split()))\r\ndef getListGraph():\r\n    return list(map(lambda x:int(x) -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: This is a hard version of the problem. The only difference between an easy and a hard version is in the number of queries.Polycarp grew a tree from $$$n$$$ vertices. We remind you that a tree of $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n-1$$$ edges that does not contain cycles.He calls a set of vertices passable if there is such a path in the tree that passes through each vertex of this set without passing through any edge twice. The path can visit other vertices (not from this set).In other words, a set of vertices is called passable if there is a simple path that passes through all the vertices of this set (and possibly some other).For example, for a tree below sets $$$\\{3, 2, 5\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 5, 4\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 4\\}$$$ are passable, and $$$\\{1, 3, 5\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$$$ are not.  Polycarp asks you to answer $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is a set of vertices. For each query, you need to determine whether the corresponding set of vertices is passable.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 number of vertices. Following $$$n - 1$$$ lines a description of the tree.. Each line contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\ne v$$$) \u2014 indices of vertices connected by an edge. Following line contains single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 number of queries. The following $$$2 \\cdot q$$$ lines contain descriptions of sets. The first line of the description contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) \u2014 the size of the set. The second line of the description contains $$$k$$$ of distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) \u2014 indices of the vertices of the set. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ values for all queries does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Output $$$q$$$ lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding query. As an answer, output \"YES\" if the set is passable, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\nCode:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom decimal import *\r\nfrom heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush\r\nimport math\r\nimport random\r\nimport string\r\nfrom copy import deepcopy\r\nfrom itertools import combinations, permutations, product\r\nfrom operator import mul, itemgetter\r\nfrom functools import reduce, lru_cache\r\nfrom bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right\r\n\r\ndef input():\r\n    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\r\ndef getN():\r\n    return int(input())\r\ndef getNM():\r\n    return map(int, input().split())\r\ndef getList():\r\n    return list(map(int, input().split()))\r\ndef getListGraph():\r\n    return list(map(lambda x:int(x) -

Following $$$n - 1$$$ lines a description of the tree.. Each line contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\ne v$$$) \u2014 indices of vertices connected by an edge. Following line contains single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 number of queries. The following $$$2 \\cdot q$$$ lines contain descriptions of sets. The first line of the description contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) \u2014 the size of the set. The second line of the description contains $$$k$$$ of distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) \u2014 indices of the vertices of the set. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ values for all queries does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Output $$$q$$$ lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding query. As an answer, output \"YES\" if the set is passable, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\nCode:\n\nfrom sys import stdin\r\ninput = stdin.readline\r\n\r\ninp = lambda : list(map(int,input().split()))\r\n\r\ndef dfs(p , prev , lvl):\r\n\r\n    s = [[p , prev , lvl]]\r\n\r\n    while(len(s)):\r\n\r\n        p , prev , lvl = s.pop()\r\n\r\n        level[p] = lvl\r\n        parent[p][0] = prev\r\n        for i in child[p]:\r\n            if# TODO: Your code herecontinue\r\n\r\n            s.append([i , p , lvl + 1])\r\n\r\ndef lca(u,v):\r\n\r\n    if(level[u] > level[v]):u,v=v,u\r\n\r\n    dist=level[v] -

The only difference between an easy and a hard version is in the number of queries.Polycarp grew a tree from $$$n$$$ vertices. We remind you that a tree of $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n-1$$$ edges that does not contain cycles.He calls a set of vertices passable if there is such a path in the tree that passes through each vertex of this set without passing through any edge twice. The path can visit other vertices (not from this set).In other words, a set of vertices is called passable if there is a simple path that passes through all the vertices of this set (and possibly some other).For example, for a tree below sets $$$\\{3, 2, 5\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 5, 4\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 4\\}$$$ are passable, and $$$\\{1, 3, 5\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$$$ are not.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: This is a hard version of the problem. The only difference between an easy and a hard version is in the number of queries.Polycarp grew a tree from $$$n$$$ vertices. We remind you that a tree of $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n-1$$$ edges that does not contain cycles.He calls a set of vertices passable if there is such a path in the tree that passes through each vertex of this set without passing through any edge twice. The path can visit other vertices (not from this set).In other words, a set of vertices is called passable if there is a simple path that passes through all the vertices of this set (and possibly some other).For example, for a tree below sets $$$\\{3, 2, 5\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 5, 4\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 4\\}$$$ are passable, and $$$\\{1, 3, 5\\}$$$, $$$\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$$$ are not.  Polycarp asks you to answer $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is a set of vertices. For each query, you need to determine whether the corresponding set of vertices is passable.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 number of vertices. Following $$$n - 1$$$ lines a description of the tree.. Each line contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\ne v$$$) \u2014 indices of vertices connected by an edge. Following line contains single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 number of queries. The following $$$2 \\cdot q$$$ lines contain descriptions of sets. The first line of the description contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) \u2014 the size of the set. The second line of the description contains $$$k$$$ of distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) \u2014 indices of the vertices of the set. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ values for all queries does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Output $$$q$$$ lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding query. As an answer, output \"YES\" if the set is passable, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\n\n\nclass LCA:\n    def __init__(self, g, root=0):\n        self.g = g\n        self.root = root\n        n = len(g)\n        self.logn = (n -

Specifically, they have $$$n$$$ piles of stones of sizes $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. These piles are arranged in a circle.The game goes as follows. Players take turns removing some positive number of stones from a pile in clockwise order starting from pile $$$1$$$. Formally, if a player removed stones from pile $$$i$$$ on a turn, the other player removes stones from pile $$$((i\\bmod n) + 1)$$$ on the next turn.If a player cannot remove any stones on their turn (because the pile is empty), they lose.

The game is played on a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, filled with distinct integers. We denote the square on the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$) row and $$$j$$$-th ($$$1\\le j\\le m$$$) column by $$$(i, j)$$$ and the number there by $$$a_{ij}$$$.Michael starts by saying two numbers $$$h$$$ ($$$1\\le h \\le n$$$) and $$$w$$$ ($$$1\\le w \\le m$$$). Then Joe picks any $$$h\\times w$$$ subrectangle of the board (without Michael seeing).Formally, an $$$h\\times w$$$ subrectangle starts at some square $$$(a,b)$$$ where $$$1 \\le a \\le n-h+1$$$ and $$$1 \\le b \\le m-w+1$$$. It contains all squares $$$(i,j)$$$ for $$$a \\le i \\le a+h-1$$$ and $$$b \\le j \\le b+w-1$$$.    Possible move by Joe if Michael says $$$3\\times 2$$$ (with maximum of $$$15$$$). Finally, Michael has to guess the maximum number in the subrectangle. He wins if he gets it right.Because Michael doesn't like big numbers, he wants the area of the chosen subrectangle (that is, $$$h \\cdot w$$$), to be as small as possible, while still ensuring that he wins, not depending on Joe's choice.

For the special array $$$c_k$$$, Eric uses only operation 2 on it at least once.Lastly, Eric discards the array $$$b$$$.For given arrays $$$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$$$, your task is to find out the special array, i.e. the value $$$k$$$.

It can be shown that under the constraints given in the problem, this value is unique and won't exceed $$$10^{18}$$$, so you can represent it as a $$$64$$$-bit integer.

In the third test case, all pixels already have the same color.In the fourth test case, you may leave any of the pixels unchanged, and paint all three other pixels into the color of that pixel in three moves.In the fifth test case, you can paint both top pixels into the color x.\n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    input_arr = sys.stdin.read().split()\r\n    tc = int(input_arr[0])\r\n    pos = 1\r\n    for case in range(tc):\r\n        a1, a2 = input_arr[pos:pos + 2]\r\n        char = []\r\n        for i in a1:\r\n            char.append(i)\r\n        for j in a2:\r\n            char.append(j)\r\n        l = len(set(char))\r\n        if l == 4:\r\n            print(3)\r\n        elif l == 3:\r\n            print(2)\r\n        elif # TODO: Your code here\r\n            print(1)\r\n        elif l == 1:\r\n            print(0)\r\n        pos += 2\r\n", "eval_prompt": "import sys\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    input_arr = sys.stdin.read().split()\r\n    tc = int(input_arr[0])\r\n    pos = 1\r\n    for case in range(tc):\r\n        a1, a2 = input_arr[pos:pos + 2]\r\n        char = []\r\n        for i in a1:\r\n            char.append(i)\r\n        for j in a2:\r\n            char.append(j)\r\n        l = len(set(char))\r\n        if l == 4:\r\n            print(3)\r\n        elif l == 3:\r\n            print(2)\r\n        elif {{completion}}\r\n            print(1)\r\n        elif l == 1:\r\n            print(0)\r\n        pos += 2\r\n", "ground_truth": "l == 2:", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"5\\n\\nrb\\n\\nbr\\n\\ncc\\n\\nwb\\n\\naa\\n\\naa\\n\\nab\\n\\ncd\\n\\nyy\\n\\nxx\", \"output\": [\"1\\n2\\n0\\n3\\n1\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_002661", "full_ground_truth": "import sys\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    input_arr = sys.stdin.read().split()\r\n    tc = int(input_arr[0])\r\n    pos = 1\r\n    for case in range(tc):\r\n        a1, a2 = input_arr[pos:pos + 2]\r\n        char = []\r\n        for i in a1:\r\n            char.append(i)\r\n        for j in a2:\r\n            char.append(j)\r\n        l = len(set(char))\r\n        if l == 4:\r\n            print(3)\r\n        elif l == 3:\r\n            print(2)\r\n        elif l == 2:\r\n            print(1)\r\n        elif l == 1:\r\n            print(0)\r\n        pos += 2\r\n"}

Let's say that a tree is good if no simple path has weight $$$0$$$.You can apply the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): select a vertex of the tree and replace the value written on it with an arbitrary positive integer. What is the minimum number of times you have to apply this operation in order to make the tree good?\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i &lt; 2^{30}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers written on vertices. Then $$$n - 1$$$ lines follow, each containing two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n; x \\ne y$$$) denoting an edge connecting vertex $$$x$$$ with vertex $$$y$$$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.\n\nOutput Specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of times you have to apply the operation in order to make the tree good.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example, it is enough to replace the value on the vertex $$$1$$$ with $$$13$$$, and the value on the vertex $$$4$$$ with $$$42$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nimport sys \nfrom types import GeneratorType\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef bootstrap(f, stack=[]):\n    def wrappedfunc(*args, **kwargs):\n        if stack:\n            return f(*args, **kwargs)\n        else:\n            to = f(*args, **kwargs)\n            while True:\n                if type(to) is GeneratorType:\n                    stack.append(to)\n                    to = next(to)\n                else:\n                    stack.pop()\n                    if # TODO: Your code here\n                        break\n                    to = stack[-1].send(to)\n            return to\n    return wrappedfunc\n\ninput = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\n\ndef solve():\n\n    N = int(input())\n    A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n\n    G = [[] for _ in range(N)]\n    for _ in range(N -

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i &lt; 2^{30}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers written on vertices. Then $$$n - 1$$$ lines follow, each containing two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n; x \\ne y$$$) denoting an edge connecting vertex $$$x$$$ with vertex $$$y$$$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.\n\nOutput Specification: Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of times you have to apply the operation in order to make the tree good.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example, it is enough to replace the value on the vertex $$$1$$$ with $$$13$$$, and the value on the vertex $$$4$$$ with $$$42$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\n\ninput = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nadj = [[] for _ in range(N)]\nfor _ in range(N - 1):\n    a, b = map(lambda s: int(s) - 1, input().split())\n    adj[a].append(b)\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\n\nO = [0]\nfor i in O:\n    for j in adj[i]:\n        adj[j].remove(i)\n        O.append(j)\n\n\nclass XORSet:\n    def __init__(self, el=None):\n        self.s = set()\n        self.xor = 0\n        if el is not None:\n            self.s.add(el)\n\n    def add(self, el: int):\n        self.s.add(el ^ self.xor)\n\n    def update(self, xor: int):\n        self.xor ^= xor\n\n    def __len__(self) -> int:\n        return len(self.s)\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return (x ^ self.xor for x in self.s)\n\n    def __contains__(self, el: int) -> bool:\n        return (el ^ self.xor) in self.s\n\nr = 0\nD = [XORSet(a) for a in A]\nfor i in reversed(O):\n    for j in adj[i]:\n        if len(D[j]) > len(D[i]):\n            D[i], D[j] = D[j], D[i]\n            D[i].update(A[i])\n            D[j].update(A[i])\n\n        l = list(D[j])\n        for x in l:\n            if x in D[i]:\n                r += 1\n                D[i].s.clear()\n                break\n        else:\n            for # TODO: Your code here\n                D[i].add(x ^ A[i])\n\n            continue\n\n        break\n\n    #print(i, A[i], adj[i], list(D[i]))\n\nprint(r)\n", "eval_prompt": "import sys\n\ninput = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nadj = [[] for _ in range(N)]\nfor _ in range(N - 1):\n    a, b = map(lambda s: int(s) - 1, input().split())\n    adj[a].append(b)\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\n\nO = [0]\nfor i in O:\n    for j in adj[i]:\n        adj[j].remove(i)\n        O.append(j)\n\n\nclass XORSet:\n    def __init__(self, el=None):\n        self.s = set()\n        self.xor = 0\n        if el is not None:\n            self.s.add(el)\n\n    def add(self, el: int):\n        self.s.add(el ^ self.xor)\n\n    def update(self, xor: int):\n        self.xor ^= xor\n\n    def __len__(self) -> int:\n        return len(self.s)\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return (x ^ self.xor for x in self.s)\n\n    def __contains__(self, el: int) -> bool:\n        return (el ^ self.xor) in self.s\n\nr = 0\nD = [XORSet(a) for a in A]\nfor i in reversed(O):\n    for j in adj[i]:\n        if len(D[j]) > len(D[i]):\n            D[i], D[j] = D[j], D[i]\n            D[i].update(A[i])\n            D[j].update(A[i])\n\n        l = list(D[j])\n        for x in l:\n            if x in D[i]:\n                r += 1\n                D[i].s.clear()\n                break\n        else:\n            for {{completion}}\n                D[i].add(x ^ A[i])\n\n            continue\n\n        break\n\n    #print(i, A[i], adj[i], list(D[i]))\n\nprint(r)\n", "ground_truth": "x in l:", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"6\\n3 2 1 3 2 1\\n4 5\\n3 4\\n1 4\\n2 1\\n6 1\", \"output\": [\"2\"]}, {\"input\": \"4\\n2 1 1 1\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\", \"output\": [\"0\"]}, {\"input\": \"5\\n2 2 2 2 2\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n4 5\", \"output\": [\"2\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_002989", "full_ground_truth": "import sys\n\ninput = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nadj = [[] for _ in range(N)]\nfor _ in range(N - 1):\n    a, b = map(lambda s: int(s) - 1, input().split())\n    adj[a].append(b)\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\n\nO = [0]\nfor i in O:\n    for j in adj[i]:\n        adj[j].remove(i)\n        O.append(j)\n\n\nclass XORSet:\n    def __init__(self, el=None):\n        self.s = set()\n        self.xor = 0\n        if el is not None:\n            self.s.add(el)\n\n    def add(self, el: int):\n        self.s.add(el ^ self.xor)\n\n    def update(self, xor: int):\n        self.xor ^= xor\n\n    def __len__(self) -> int:\n        return len(self.s)\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return (x ^ self.xor for x in self.s)\n\n    def __contains__(self, el: int) -> bool:\n        return (el ^ self.xor) in self.s\n\nr = 0\nD = [XORSet(a) for a in A]\nfor i in reversed(O):\n    for j in adj[i]:\n        if len(D[j]) > len(D[i]):\n            D[i], D[j] = D[j], D[i]\n            D[i].update(A[i])\n            D[j].update(A[i])\n\n        l = list(D[j])\n        for x in l:\n            if x in D[i]:\n                r += 1\n                D[i].s.clear()\n                break\n        else:\n            for x in l:\n                D[i].add(x ^ A[i])\n\n            continue\n\n        break\n\n    #print(i, A[i], adj[i], list(D[i]))\n\nprint(r)\n"}

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Leslie and Leon entered a labyrinth. The labyrinth consists of $$$n$$$ halls and $$$m$$$ one-way passages between\u00a0them. The halls are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.Leslie and Leon start their journey in the hall $$$s$$$. Right away, they quarrel and decide to explore the\u00a0labyrinth separately. However, they want to meet again at the end of their journey.To help Leslie and Leon, your task is to find two different paths from the given hall $$$s$$$ to some other hall $$$t$$$, such that these two paths do not share halls other than the staring hall $$$s$$$ and the ending hall $$$t$$$. The\u00a0hall\u00a0$$$t$$$ has not been determined yet, so you can choose any of the labyrinth's halls as $$$t$$$ except $$$s$$$.Leslie's and Leon's paths do not have to be the shortest ones, but their paths must be simple, visiting any hall at most once. Also, they cannot visit any common halls except $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ during their journey, even at different times.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$s$$$, where $$$n$$$\u00a0($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) is the number of vertices, $$$m$$$\u00a0($$$0 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) is the number of edges in the labyrinth, and $$$s$$$\u00a0($$$1 \\le s \\le n$$$) is the starting hall. Then $$$m$$$ lines with descriptions of passages follow. Each description contains two integers $$$u_i$$$,\u00a0$$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$$$; $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$), denoting a passage from the hall $$$u_i$$$ to the hall $$$v_i$$$. The passages are one-way. Each tuple $$$(u_i, v_i)$$$ is present in the input at most once. The labyrinth can contain cycles and is not necessarily connected in any way.\n\nOutput Specification: If it is possible to find the desired two paths, output \"Possible\", otherwise output \"Impossible\". If the answer exists, output two path descriptions. Each description occupies two lines. The first line of the description contains an integer $$$h$$$ ($$$2 \\le h \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of halls in a path, and the second line contains distinct integers $$$w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_h$$$ ($$$w_1 = s$$$; $$$1 \\le w_j \\le n$$$; $$$w_h = t$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the halls in the path in the order of passing. Both paths must end at the same vertex $$$t$$$. The paths must be different, and all intermediate halls in these paths must be distinct.\n\nCode:\n\ndef DFS(start):\r\n    nodes=set()\r\n    stack=[start]\r\n    while stack:\r\n

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Julia's $$$n$$$ friends want to organize a startup in a new country they moved to. They assigned each other numbers from 1 to $$$n$$$ according to the jobs they have, from the most front-end tasks to the most back-end ones. They also estimated a matrix $$$c$$$, where $$$c_{ij} = c_{ji}$$$ is the average number of messages per month between people doing jobs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$.Now they want to make a hierarchy tree. It will be a binary tree with each node containing one member of the team. Some member will be selected as a leader of the team and will be contained in the root node. In order for the leader to be able to easily reach any subordinate, for each node $$$v$$$ of the tree, the following should apply: all members in its left subtree must have smaller numbers than $$$v$$$, and all members in its right subtree must have larger numbers than $$$v$$$.After the hierarchy tree is settled, people doing jobs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ will be communicating via the shortest path in the tree between their nodes. Let's denote the length of this path as $$$d_{ij}$$$. Thus, the cost of their communication is $$$c_{ij} \\cdot d_{ij}$$$.Your task is to find a hierarchy tree that minimizes the total cost of communication over all pairs: $$$\\sum_{1 \\le i &lt; j \\le n} c_{ij} \\cdot d_{ij}$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 200$$$)\u00a0\u2013 the number of team members organizing a startup. The next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ integers each, $$$j$$$-th number in $$$i$$$-th line is $$$c_{ij}$$$\u00a0\u2014 the estimated number of messages per month between team members $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_{ij} \\le 10^9; c_{ij} = c_{ji}; c_{ii} = 0$$$).\n\nOutput Specification: Output a description of a hierarchy tree that minimizes the total cost of communication. To do so, for each team member from 1 to $$$n$$$ output the number of the member in its parent node, or 0 for the leader. If there are many optimal trees, output a description of any one of them.\n\nNotes: NoteThe minimal possible total cost is $$$566 \\cdot 1+239 \\cdot 1+30 \\cdot 1+1 \\cdot 2+1 \\cdot 2=839$$$:  \n\nCode:\n\nn=int(input())\r\nc=[]\r\nfor _ in range(n):\r\n    c.append(tuple(map(int,input().split())))\r\nprefix_sum=[[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\r\nfor i in range(1,n+1):\r\n    temp=0\r\n    for j in range(1,n+1):\r\n        temp+=c[i-1][j-1]\r\n        prefix_sum[i][j]+=prefix_sum[i-1][j]+temp\r\ndef get_rectangel_sum(x1,y1,x2,y2):\r\n    return prefix_sum[x2+1][y2+1]-prefix_sum[x1][y2+1]-prefix_sum[x2+1][y1]+prefix_sum[x1][y1]\r\ndef cost(x,y):\r\n    if x>y:\r\n        return 0\r\n    a=get_rectangel_sum(x,0,y,x-1) if x!=0 else 0\r\n    b=get_rectangel_sum(x,y+1,y,n-1) if y!=n-1 else 0\r\n    return a+b\r\ndp=[[float(\"INF\")]*n for _ in range(n)]\r\nbest_root_for_range=[[-1]*n for _ in range(n)]\r\nfor i in range(n):\r\n    dp[i][i]=0\r\n    best_root_for_range[i][i]=i\r\ndef get_dp_cost(x,y):\r\n    return dp[x][y] if x<=y else 0\r\nfor length in range(1,n):\r\n    #

Your task is to determine the minimum number of days required to water the trees so they grow to the same height.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of trees. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le h_i \\le 10^9$$$), where $$$h_i$$$ is the height of the $$$i$$$-th tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\sum n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of days required to water the trees, so they grow to the same height.\n\nNotes: NoteConsider the first test case of the example. The initial state of the trees is $$$[1, 2, 4]$$$.  During the first day, let's water the first tree, so the sequence of heights becomes $$$[2, 2, 4]$$$;  during the second day, let's water the second tree, so the sequence of heights becomes $$$[2, 4, 4]$$$;  let's skip the third day;  during the fourth day, let's water the first tree, so the sequence of heights becomes $$$[4, 4, 4]$$$. Thus, the answer is $$$4$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nfor ii in range(int(input())):\r\n\tn=int(input())\r\n\ta = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\n\tm=max(a)\r\n\tans=float(\"inf\")\r\n\tfor jj in range(m,m+4):\r\n\t\tx,y=0,0\r\n\t\tfor # TODO: Your code here\r\n\t\t\tx+=(jj-kk)%2\r\n\t\t\ty+=(jj-kk)//2\r\n\t\tans=min(max(((x+y*2)//3*2)+(x+y*2)%3,x*2-1),ans)\r\n\tprint(ans)", "eval_prompt": "for ii in range(int(input())):\r\n\tn=int(input())\r\n\ta = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\n\tm=max(a)\r\n\tans=float(\"inf\")\r\n\tfor jj in range(m,m+4):\r\n\t\tx,y=0,0\r\n\t\tfor {{completion}}\r\n\t\t\tx+=(jj-kk)%2\r\n\t\t\ty+=(jj-kk)//2\r\n\t\tans=min(max(((x+y*2)//3*2)+(x+y*2)%3,x*2-1),ans)\r\n\tprint(ans)", "ground_truth": "kk in a:", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"3\\n3\\n1 2 4\\n5\\n4 4 3 5 5\\n7\\n2 5 4 8 3 7 4\", \"output\": [\"4\\n3\\n16\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_003368", "full_ground_truth": "for ii in range(int(input())):\r\n\tn=int(input())\r\n\ta = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\n\tm=max(a)\r\n\tans=float(\"inf\")\r\n\tfor jj in range(m,m+4):\r\n\t\tx,y=0,0\r\n\t\tfor kk in a:\r\n\t\t\tx+=(jj-kk)%2\r\n\t\t\ty+=(jj-kk)//2\r\n\t\tans=min(max(((x+y*2)//3*2)+(x+y*2)%3,x*2-1),ans)\r\n\tprint(ans)"}

The blocks at positions $$$(0, 0)$$$, $$$(0, 1)$$$, and $$$(0, 2)$$$ all have color $$$1$$$, forming an tower of size $$$3$$$.In the second test case, note that the following placement is not valid, since you are not allowed to place block $$$6$$$ under block $$$5$$$:  It can be shown that it is impossible to form a tower of color $$$4$$$ and size $$$3$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\ntokens = ''.join(sys.stdin.readlines()).split()[::-1]\r\n\r\ndef next(): return tokens.pop()\r\ndef nextInt(): return int(next())\r\ndef nextFloat(): return float(next())\r\ndef getIntArray(n): return [nextInt() for _ in range(n)]\r\ndef getFloatArray(n): return [nextFloat() for _ in range(n)]\r\ndef getStringArray(n): return [next() for _ in range(n)]\r\n\r\n\r\ntestcase = True\r\ndef solve(testcase = 1):\r\n    N = nextInt()\r\n    A = getIntArray(N)\r\n\r\n    map = {}\r\n    for i in range(N):\r\n        if A[i] not in map: map[A[i]] = []\r\n        map[A[i]].append(i)\r\n\r\n    for color in range(1, N + 1):\r\n        if color not in map:\r\n            print(0, end=' ')\r\n            continue\r\n        ar = map[color]\r\n        oddCount = evenCount = 0\r\n        for i in ar:\r\n            if # TODO: Your code here\r\n                evenCount = max(evenCount, oddCount + 1)\r\n            else:\r\n                oddCount = max(oddCount, evenCount + 1)\r\n        print(max(oddCount, evenCount), end=' ')\r\n    print()\r\n\r\n\r\nif testcase is None:\r\n    testcaseCount = 1\r\n    while tokens:\r\n        solve(testcaseCount)\r\n        testcaseCount += 1\r\nelse:\r\n    testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\r\n    for tc in range(testcaseCount):\r\n        solve(tc + 1)\r\n    assert not tokens", "eval_prompt": "import sys\r\ntokens = ''.join(sys.stdin.readlines()).split()[::-1]\r\n\r\ndef next(): return tokens.pop()\r\ndef nextInt(): return int(next())\r\ndef nextFloat(): return float(next())\r\ndef getIntArray(n): return [nextInt() for _ in range(n)]\r\ndef getFloatArray(n): return [nextFloat() for _ in range(n)]\r\ndef getStringArray(n): return [next() for _ in range(n)]\r\n\r\n\r\ntestcase = True\r\ndef solve(testcase = 1):\r\n    N = nextInt()\r\n    A = getIntArray(N)\r\n\r\n    map = {}\r\n    for i in range(N):\r\n        if A[i] not in map: map[A[i]] = []\r\n        map[A[i]].append(i)\r\n\r\n    for color in range(1, N + 1):\r\n        if color not in map:\r\n            print(0, end=' ')\r\n            continue\r\n        ar = map[color]\r\n        oddCount = evenCount = 0\r\n        for i in ar:\r\n            if {{completion}}\r\n                evenCount = max(evenCount, oddCount + 1)\r\n            else:\r\n                oddCount = max(oddCount, evenCount + 1)\r\n        print(max(oddCount, evenCount), end=' ')\r\n    print()\r\n\r\n\r\nif testcase is None:\r\n    testcaseCount = 1\r\n    while tokens:\r\n        solve(testcaseCount)\r\n        testcaseCount += 1\r\nelse:\r\n    testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\r\n    for tc in range(testcaseCount):\r\n        solve(tc + 1)\r\n    assert not tokens", "ground_truth": "i % 2 == 0:", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"6\\n\\n7\\n\\n1 2 3 1 2 3 1\\n\\n6\\n\\n4 2 2 2 4 4\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n5\\n\\n5 4 5 3 5\\n\\n6\\n\\n3 3 3 1 3 3\\n\\n8\\n\\n1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1\", \"output\": [\"3 2 2 0 0 0 0 \\n0 3 0 2 0 0 \\n1 \\n0 0 1 1 1 \\n1 0 4 0 0 0 \\n2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_003617", "full_ground_truth": "import sys\r\ntokens = ''.join(sys.stdin.readlines()).split()[::-1]\r\n\r\ndef next(): return tokens.pop()\r\ndef nextInt(): return int(next())\r\ndef nextFloat(): return float(next())\r\ndef getIntArray(n): return [nextInt() for _ in range(n)]\r\ndef getFloatArray(n): return [nextFloat() for _ in range(n)]\r\ndef getStringArray(n): return [next() for _ in range(n)]\r\n\r\n\r\ntestcase = True\r\ndef solve(testcase = 1):\r\n    N = nextInt()\r\n    A = getIntArray(N)\r\n\r\n    map = {}\r\n    for i in range(N):\r\n        if A[i] not in map: map[A[i]] = []\r\n        map[A[i]].append(i)\r\n\r\n    for color in range(1, N + 1):\r\n        if color not in map:\r\n            print(0, end=' ')\r\n            continue\r\n        ar = map[color]\r\n        oddCount = evenCount = 0\r\n        for i in ar:\r\n            if i % 2 == 0:\r\n                evenCount = max(evenCount, oddCount + 1)\r\n            else:\r\n                oddCount = max(oddCount, evenCount + 1)\r\n        print(max(oddCount, evenCount), end=' ')\r\n    print()\r\n\r\n\r\nif testcase is None:\r\n    testcaseCount = 1\r\n    while tokens:\r\n        solve(testcaseCount)\r\n        testcaseCount += 1\r\nelse:\r\n    testcaseCount = nextInt() if testcase else 1\r\n    for tc in range(testcaseCount):\r\n        solve(tc + 1)\r\n    assert not tokens"}

It can be proven that there is no other way that is faster.\n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\ninput=sys.stdin.readline\r\n\r\nfrom heapq import heappush,heappop,heapify \r\nfrom collections import defaultdict\r\n \r\ndef main():\r\n\tn,m=map(int,input().split())\r\n\tgf=defaultdict(list)\r\n\tgb=defaultdict(list)\r\n\tfor _ in range(m):\r\n\t\tu,v,w=map(int,input().split())\r\n\t\tgf[u].append((v,w))\r\n\t\tgb[v].append((u,w))\r\n\tdis=[float('inf')]*(n+1)\r\n\tdis[1]=0\r\n\th=[]\r\n\theapify(h)\r\n\theappush(h,(0,1))\r\n\twhile h:\r\n\t\tcd,cn=heappop(h)\r\n\t\tif dis[cn]==cd:\r\n\t\t\tfor nn,nw in gf[cn]:\r\n\t\t\t\tif cd+nw<dis[nn]:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdis[nn]=cd+nw\r\n\t\t\t\t\theappush(h,(nw+cd,nn))\r\n\tres=[float('inf')]*(n+1)\r\n\tres[1]=0\r\n\th=[]\r\n\tfor i in range(1,n+1):\r\n\t\tif dis[i]!=float('inf'):\r\n\t\t\tres[i]=dis[i]\r\n\t\t\th.append((dis[i],i))\r\n\theapify(h)\r\n\twhile h:\r\n\t\tcd,cn=heappop(h)\r\n\t\tif res[cn]==cd:\r\n\t\t\tfor nn,nw in gb[cn]:\r\n\t\t\t\tif # TODO: Your code here\r\n\t\t\t\t\tres[nn]=cd+nw\r\n\t\t\t\t\theappush(h,(nw+cd,nn))\r\n\tfor i in range(1,len(res)):\r\n\t\tif res[i]==float('inf'):res[i]=-1\r\n\tprint(*res[2:])\r\n\r\nmain()", "eval_prompt": "import sys\r\ninput=sys.stdin.readline\r\n\r\nfrom heapq import heappush,heappop,heapify \r\nfrom collections import defaultdict\r\n \r\ndef main():\r\n\tn,m=map(int,input().split())\r\n\tgf=defaultdict(list)\r\n\tgb=defaultdict(list)\r\n\tfor _ in range(m):\r\n\t\tu,v,w=map(int,input().split())\r\n\t\tgf[u].append((v,w))\r\n\t\tgb[v].append((u,w))\r\n\tdis=[float('inf')]*(n+1)\r\n\tdis[1]=0\r\n\th=[]\r\n\theapify(h)\r\n\theappush(h,(0,1))\r\n\twhile h:\r\n\t\tcd,cn=heappop(h)\r\n\t\tif dis[cn]==cd:\r\n\t\t\tfor nn,nw in gf[cn]:\r\n\t\t\t\tif cd+nw<dis[nn]:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdis[nn]=cd+nw\r\n\t\t\t\t\theappush(h,(nw+cd,nn))\r\n\tres=[float('inf')]*(n+1)\r\n\tres[1]=0\r\n\th=[]\r\n\tfor i in range(1,n+1):\r\n\t\tif dis[i]!=float('inf'):\r\n\t\t\tres[i]=dis[i]\r\n\t\t\th.append((dis[i],i))\r\n\theapify(h)\r\n\twhile h:\r\n\t\tcd,cn=heappop(h)\r\n\t\tif res[cn]==cd:\r\n\t\t\tfor nn,nw in gb[cn]:\r\n\t\t\t\tif {{completion}}\r\n\t\t\t\t\tres[nn]=cd+nw\r\n\t\t\t\t\theappush(h,(nw+cd,nn))\r\n\tfor i in range(1,len(res)):\r\n\t\tif res[i]==float('inf'):res[i]=-1\r\n\tprint(*res[2:])\r\n\r\nmain()", "ground_truth": "cd+nw<res[nn]:", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"5 7\\n1 2 2\\n2 4 1\\n4 1 4\\n2 5 3\\n5 4 1\\n5 2 4\\n2 1 1\", \"output\": [\"1 -1 3 4\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_003686", "full_ground_truth": "import sys\r\ninput=sys.stdin.readline\r\n\r\nfrom heapq import heappush,heappop,heapify \r\nfrom collections import defaultdict\r\n \r\ndef main():\r\n\tn,m=map(int,input().split())\r\n\tgf=defaultdict(list)\r\n\tgb=defaultdict(list)\r\n\tfor _ in range(m):\r\n\t\tu,v,w=map(int,input().split())\r\n\t\tgf[u].append((v,w))\r\n\t\tgb[v].append((u,w))\r\n\tdis=[float('inf')]*(n+1)\r\n\tdis[1]=0\r\n\th=[]\r\n\theapify(h)\r\n\theappush(h,(0,1))\r\n\twhile h:\r\n\t\tcd,cn=heappop(h)\r\n\t\tif dis[cn]==cd:\r\n\t\t\tfor nn,nw in gf[cn]:\r\n\t\t\t\tif cd+nw<dis[nn]:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdis[nn]=cd+nw\r\n\t\t\t\t\theappush(h,(nw+cd,nn))\r\n\tres=[float('inf')]*(n+1)\r\n\tres[1]=0\r\n\th=[]\r\n\tfor i in range(1,n+1):\r\n\t\tif dis[i]!=float('inf'):\r\n\t\t\tres[i]=dis[i]\r\n\t\t\th.append((dis[i],i))\r\n\theapify(h)\r\n\twhile h:\r\n\t\tcd,cn=heappop(h)\r\n\t\tif res[cn]==cd:\r\n\t\t\tfor nn,nw in gb[cn]:\r\n\t\t\t\tif cd+nw<res[nn]:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tres[nn]=cd+nw\r\n\t\t\t\t\theappush(h,(nw+cd,nn))\r\n\tfor i in range(1,len(res)):\r\n\t\tif res[i]==float('inf'):res[i]=-1\r\n\tprint(*res[2:])\r\n\r\nmain()"}

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Pak Chanek has a mirror in the shape of a circle. There are $$$N$$$ lamps on the circumference numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$ in clockwise order. The length of the arc from lamp $$$i$$$ to lamp $$$i+1$$$ is $$$D_i$$$ for $$$1 \\leq i \\leq N-1$$$. Meanwhile, the length of the arc between lamp $$$N$$$ and lamp $$$1$$$ is $$$D_N$$$.Pak Chanek wants to colour the lamps with $$$M$$$ different colours. Each lamp can be coloured with one of the $$$M$$$ colours. However, there cannot be three different lamps such that the colours of the three lamps are the same and the triangle made by considering the three lamps as vertices is a right triangle (triangle with one of its angles being exactly $$$90$$$ degrees).The following are examples of lamp colouring configurations on the circular mirror. Figure 1. an example of an incorrect colouring because lamps $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$ form a right triangleFigure 2. an example of a correct colouringFigure 3. an example of a correct colouring Before colouring the lamps, Pak Chanek wants to know the number of distinct colouring configurations he can make. Count the number of distinct possible lamp colouring configurations, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \\le N \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \\le M \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of lamps in the mirror and the number of different colours used. The second line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_N$$$ ($$$1 \\le D_i \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the lengths of the arcs between the lamps in the mirror.\n\nOutput Specification: An integer representing the number of possible lamp colouring configurations, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example, all correct lamp colouring configurations are $$$[1, 1, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 1, 2, 2]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 2, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 1, 1]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[2, 2, 1, 1]$$$, and $$$[2, 2, 1, 2]$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nfrom math import comb\r\ndef bpow(a,n,p):\r\n    res = 1\r\n    while n:\r\n        if # TODO: Your code here\r\n            res = (res*a)%p\r\n            n-=1\r\n        else:\r\n            a = (a*a)%p\r\n            n//=2\r\n    return res\r\nN = 3 * 10**5 + 5\r\n \r\nfactorialNumInverse = [None] * (N + 1)\r\n \r\nnaturalNumInverse = [None] * (N + 1)\r\n \r\nfact = [None] * (N + 1)\r\n \r\ndef InverseofNumber(p):\r\n    naturalNumInverse[0] = naturalNumInverse[1] = 1\r\n    for i in range(2, N + 1, 1):\r\n        naturalNumInverse[i] = (naturalNumInverse[p % i] *\r\n                                   (p -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Pupils Alice and Ibragim are best friends. It's Ibragim's birthday soon, so Alice decided to gift him a new puzzle. The puzzle can be represented as a matrix with $$$2$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns, every element of which is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. In one move you can swap two values in neighboring cells.More formally, let's number rows $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$ from top to bottom, and columns $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Also, let's denote a cell in row $$$x$$$ and column $$$y$$$ as $$$(x, y)$$$. We consider cells $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ neighboring if $$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| = 1$$$.Alice doesn't like the way in which the cells are currently arranged, so she came up with her own arrangement, with which she wants to gift the puzzle to Ibragim. Since you are her smartest friend, she asked you to help her find the minimal possible number of operations in which she can get the desired arrangement. Find this number, or determine that it's not possible to get the new arrangement.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 200\\,000$$$) \u2014 the number of columns in the puzzle. Following two lines describe the current arrangement on the puzzle. Each line contains $$$n$$$ integers, every one of which is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.

There are now $$$n$$$ locks, the $$$i$$$-th of them has the volume of $$$v_i$$$ liters, so that it can contain any amount of water between $$$0$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ liters. Each lock has a pipe attached to it. When the pipe is open, $$$1$$$ liter of water enters the lock every second.The locks system is built in a way to immediately transfer all water exceeding the volume of the lock $$$i$$$ to the lock $$$i + 1$$$. If the lock $$$i + 1$$$ is also full, water will be transferred further. Water exceeding the volume of the last lock pours out to the river.   The picture illustrates $$$5$$$ locks with two open pipes at locks $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$. Because locks $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, and $$$4$$$ are already filled, effectively the water goes to locks $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$. Note that the volume of the $$$i$$$-th lock may be greater than the volume of the $$$i + 1$$$-th lock.To make all locks work, you need to completely fill each one of them. The mayor of Divanovo is interested in $$$q$$$ independent queries. For each query, suppose that initially all locks are empty and all pipes are closed. Then, some pipes are opened simultaneously. For the $$$j$$$-th query the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled no later than after $$$t_j$$$ seconds.Please help the mayor to solve this tricky problem and answer his queries. \n\nInput Specification: The first lines contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of locks.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Little pirate Serega robbed a ship with puzzles of different kinds. Among all kinds, he liked only one, the hardest.A puzzle is a table of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, whose cells contain each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \\cdot m$$$ exactly once.To solve a puzzle, you have to find a sequence of cells in the table, such that any two consecutive cells are adjacent by the side in the table. The sequence can have arbitrary length and should visit each cell one or more times. For a cell containing the number $$$i$$$, denote the position of the first occurrence of this cell in the sequence as $$$t_i$$$. The sequence solves the puzzle, if $$$t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; t_{nm}$$$. In other words, the cell with number $$$x$$$ should be first visited before the cell with number $$$x + 1$$$ for each $$$x$$$.Let's call a puzzle solvable, if there exists at least one suitable sequence.In one move Serega can choose two arbitrary cells in the table (not necessarily adjacent by the side) and swap their numbers.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Little pirate Serega robbed a ship with puzzles of different kinds. Among all kinds, he liked only one, the hardest.A puzzle is a table of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, whose cells contain each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \\cdot m$$$ exactly once.To solve a puzzle, you have to find a sequence of cells in the table, such that any two consecutive cells are adjacent by the side in the table. The sequence can have arbitrary length and should visit each cell one or more times. For a cell containing the number $$$i$$$, denote the position of the first occurrence of this cell in the sequence as $$$t_i$$$. The sequence solves the puzzle, if $$$t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; t_{nm}$$$. In other words, the cell with number $$$x$$$ should be first visited before the cell with number $$$x + 1$$$ for each $$$x$$$.Let's call a puzzle solvable, if there exists at least one suitable sequence.In one move Serega can choose two arbitrary cells in the table (not necessarily adjacent by the side) and swap their numbers. He would like to know the minimum number of moves to make his puzzle solvable, but he is too impatient. Thus, please tell if the minimum number of moves is $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, or at least $$$2$$$. In the case, where $$$1$$$ move is required, please also find the number of suitable cell pairs to swap.\n\nInput Specification: In the first line there are two whole positive numbers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n\\cdot m \\leq 400\\,000$$$) \u2014 table dimensions. In the next $$$n$$$ lines there are $$$m$$$ integer numbers $$$a_{i1}, a_{i2}, \\dots, a_{im}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{ij} \\le nm$$$).  It is guaranteed that every number from $$$1$$$ to $$$nm$$$ occurs exactly once in the table.\n\nOutput Specification: Let $$$a$$$ be the minimum number of moves to make the puzzle solvable. If $$$a = 0$$$, print $$$0$$$. If $$$a = 1$$$, print $$$1$$$ and the number of valid swaps.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Little pirate Serega robbed a ship with puzzles of different kinds. Among all kinds, he liked only one, the hardest.A puzzle is a table of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, whose cells contain each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \\cdot m$$$ exactly once.To solve a puzzle, you have to find a sequence of cells in the table, such that any two consecutive cells are adjacent by the side in the table. The sequence can have arbitrary length and should visit each cell one or more times. For a cell containing the number $$$i$$$, denote the position of the first occurrence of this cell in the sequence as $$$t_i$$$. The sequence solves the puzzle, if $$$t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; t_{nm}$$$. In other words, the cell with number $$$x$$$ should be first visited before the cell with number $$$x + 1$$$ for each $$$x$$$.Let's call a puzzle solvable, if there exists at least one suitable sequence.In one move Serega can choose two arbitrary cells in the table (not necessarily adjacent by the side) and swap their numbers. He would like to know the minimum number of moves to make his puzzle solvable, but he is too impatient. Thus, please tell if the minimum number of moves is $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, or at least $$$2$$$. In the case, where $$$1$$$ move is required, please also find the number of suitable cell pairs to swap.\n\nInput Specification: In the first line there are two whole positive numbers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n\\cdot m \\leq 400\\,000$$$) \u2014 table dimensions. In the next $$$n$$$ lines there are $$$m$$$ integer numbers $$$a_{i1}, a_{i2}, \\dots, a_{im}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{ij} \\le nm$$$).  It is guaranteed that every number from $$$1$$$ to $$$nm$$$ occurs exactly once in the table.\n\nOutput Specification: Let $$$a$$$ be the minimum number of moves to make the puzzle solvable. If $$$a = 0$$$, print $$$0$$$. If $$$a = 1$$$, print $$$1$$$ and the number of valid swaps. If $$$a \\ge 2$$$, print $$$2$$$. \n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example the sequence $$$(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)$$$ solves the puzzle, so the answer is $$$0$$$.The puzzle in the second example can't be solved, but it's solvable after any of three swaps of cells with values $$$(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Little pirate Serega robbed a ship with puzzles of different kinds. Among all kinds, he liked only one, the hardest.A puzzle is a table of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, whose cells contain each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \\cdot m$$$ exactly once.To solve a puzzle, you have to find a sequence of cells in the table, such that any two consecutive cells are adjacent by the side in the table. The sequence can have arbitrary length and should visit each cell one or more times. For a cell containing the number $$$i$$$, denote the position of the first occurrence of this cell in the sequence as $$$t_i$$$. The sequence solves the puzzle, if $$$t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; t_{nm}$$$. In other words, the cell with number $$$x$$$ should be first visited before the cell with number $$$x + 1$$$ for each $$$x$$$.Let's call a puzzle solvable, if there exists at least one suitable sequence.In one move Serega can choose two arbitrary cells in the table (not necessarily adjacent by the side) and swap their numbers. He would like to know the minimum number of moves to make his puzzle solvable, but he is too impatient. Thus, please tell if the minimum number of moves is $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, or at least $$$2$$$. In the case, where $$$1$$$ move is required, please also find the number of suitable cell pairs to swap.\n\nInput Specification: In the first line there are two whole positive numbers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n\\cdot m \\leq 400\\,000$$$) \u2014 table dimensions. In the next $$$n$$$ lines there are $$$m$$$ integer numbers $$$a_{i1}, a_{i2}, \\dots, a_{im}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{ij} \\le nm$$$).  It is guaranteed that every number from $$$1$$$ to $$$nm$$$ occurs exactly once in the table.\n\nOutput Specification: Let $$$a$$$ be the minimum number of moves to make the puzzle solvable. If $$$a = 0$$$, print $$$0$$$. If $$$a = 1$$$, print $$$1$$$ and the number of valid swaps. If $$$a \\ge 2$$$, print $$$2$$$. \n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example the sequence $$$(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)$$$ solves the puzzle, so the answer is $$$0$$$.The puzzle in the second example can't be solved, but it's solvable after any of three swaps of cells with values $$$(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Little pirate Serega robbed a ship with puzzles of different kinds. Among all kinds, he liked only one, the hardest.A puzzle is a table of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, whose cells contain each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \\cdot m$$$ exactly once.To solve a puzzle, you have to find a sequence of cells in the table, such that any two consecutive cells are adjacent by the side in the table. The sequence can have arbitrary length and should visit each cell one or more times. For a cell containing the number $$$i$$$, denote the position of the first occurrence of this cell in the sequence as $$$t_i$$$. The sequence solves the puzzle, if $$$t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; t_{nm}$$$. In other words, the cell with number $$$x$$$ should be first visited before the cell with number $$$x + 1$$$ for each $$$x$$$.Let's call a puzzle solvable, if there exists at least one suitable sequence.In one move Serega can choose two arbitrary cells in the table (not necessarily adjacent by the side) and swap their numbers. He would like to know the minimum number of moves to make his puzzle solvable, but he is too impatient. Thus, please tell if the minimum number of moves is $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, or at least $$$2$$$. In the case, where $$$1$$$ move is required, please also find the number of suitable cell pairs to swap.\n\nInput Specification: In the first line there are two whole positive numbers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n\\cdot m \\leq 400\\,000$$$) \u2014 table dimensions. In the next $$$n$$$ lines there are $$$m$$$ integer numbers $$$a_{i1}, a_{i2}, \\dots, a_{im}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{ij} \\le nm$$$).  It is guaranteed that every number from $$$1$$$ to $$$nm$$$ occurs exactly once in the table.\n\nOutput Specification: Let $$$a$$$ be the minimum number of moves to make the puzzle solvable. If $$$a = 0$$$, print $$$0$$$. If $$$a = 1$$$, print $$$1$$$ and the number of valid swaps. If $$$a \\ge 2$$$, print $$$2$$$. \n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example the sequence $$$(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)$$$ solves the puzzle, so the answer is $$$0$$$.The puzzle in the second example can't be solved, but it's solvable after any of three swaps of cells with values $$$(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)$$$. The puzzle from the third example requires at least two swaps, so the answer is $$$2$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nimport os\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\r\n\r\n#_str = str\r\n#str = lambda

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Little pirate Serega robbed a ship with puzzles of different kinds. Among all kinds, he liked only one, the hardest.A puzzle is a table of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, whose cells contain each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n \\cdot m$$$ exactly once.To solve a puzzle, you have to find a sequence of cells in the table, such that any two consecutive cells are adjacent by the side in the table. The sequence can have arbitrary length and should visit each cell one or more times. For a cell containing the number $$$i$$$, denote the position of the first occurrence of this cell in the sequence as $$$t_i$$$. The sequence solves the puzzle, if $$$t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; t_{nm}$$$. In other words, the cell with number $$$x$$$ should be first visited before the cell with number $$$x + 1$$$ for each $$$x$$$.Let's call a puzzle solvable, if there exists at least one suitable sequence.In one move Serega can choose two arbitrary cells in the table (not necessarily adjacent by the side) and swap their numbers. He would like to know the minimum number of moves to make his puzzle solvable, but he is too impatient. Thus, please tell if the minimum number of moves is $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, or at least $$$2$$$. In the case, where $$$1$$$ move is required, please also find the number of suitable cell pairs to swap.\n\nInput Specification: In the first line there are two whole positive numbers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n\\cdot m \\leq 400\\,000$$$) \u2014 table dimensions. In the next $$$n$$$ lines there are $$$m$$$ integer numbers $$$a_{i1}, a_{i2}, \\dots, a_{im}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{ij} \\le nm$$$).  It is guaranteed that every number from $$$1$$$ to $$$nm$$$ occurs exactly once in the table.\n\nOutput Specification: Let $$$a$$$ be the minimum number of moves to make the puzzle solvable. If $$$a = 0$$$, print $$$0$$$. If $$$a = 1$$$, print $$$1$$$ and the number of valid swaps. If $$$a \\ge 2$$$, print $$$2$$$. \n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example the sequence $$$(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)$$$ solves the puzzle, so the answer is $$$0$$$.The puzzle in the second example can't be solved, but it's solvable after any of three swaps of cells with values $$$(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)$$$. The puzzle from the third example requires at least two swaps, so the answer is $$$2$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nimport os\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\r\n\r\n#_str = str\r\n#str = lambda

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a vertex $$$v$$$ (different from root) is the previous to $$$v$$$ vertex on the shortest path from the root to the vertex $$$v$$$. Children of the vertex $$$v$$$ are all vertices for which $$$v$$$ is the parent.You are given a rooted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. The vertex $$$1$$$ is the root. Initially, all vertices are healthy.Each second you do two operations, the spreading operation and, after that, the injection operation:   Spreading: for each vertex $$$v$$$, if at least one child of $$$v$$$ is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of $$$v$$$ of your choice.  Injection: you can choose any healthy vertex and infect it. This process repeats each second until the whole tree is infected. You need to find the minimal number of seconds needed to infect the whole tree.\n\nInput Specification: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the vertices in the given tree. The second line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the ancestor of the $$$i$$$-th vertex in the tree. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case you should output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal number of seconds needed to infect the whole tree.\n\nNotes: NoteThe image depicts the tree from the first test case during each second.A vertex is black if it is not infected.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a vertex $$$v$$$ (different from root) is the previous to $$$v$$$ vertex on the shortest path from the root to the vertex $$$v$$$. Children of the vertex $$$v$$$ are all vertices for which $$$v$$$ is the parent.You are given a rooted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. The vertex $$$1$$$ is the root. Initially, all vertices are healthy.Each second you do two operations, the spreading operation and, after that, the injection operation:   Spreading: for each vertex $$$v$$$, if at least one child of $$$v$$$ is infected, you can spread the disease by infecting at most one other child of $$$v$$$ of your choice.  Injection: you can choose any healthy vertex and infect it. This process repeats each second until the whole tree is infected. You need to find the minimal number of seconds needed to infect the whole tree.\n\nInput Specification: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of the vertices in the given tree. The second line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the ancestor of the $$$i$$$-th vertex in the tree. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case you should output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimal number of seconds needed to infect the whole tree.\n\nNotes: NoteThe image depicts the tree from the first test case during each second.A vertex is black if it is not infected. A vertex is blue if it is infected by injection during the previous second. A vertex is green if it is infected by spreading during the previous second. A vertex is red if it is infected earlier than the previous second.

Specifically, card $$$i$$$ ($$$i &gt; 1$$$) is hanging onto card $$$p_i$$$ ($$$p_i &lt; i$$$).In the very beginning, Pak Chanek must write one integer number on each card. He does this by choosing any permutation $$$a$$$ of $$$[1, 2, \\dots, n]$$$. Then, the number written on card $$$i$$$ is $$$a_i$$$.After that, Pak Chanek must do the following operation $$$n$$$ times while maintaining a sequence $$$s$$$ (which is initially empty):  Choose a card $$$x$$$ such that no other cards are hanging onto it.  Append the number written on card $$$x$$$ to the end of $$$s$$$.  If $$$x \\neq 1$$$ and the number on card $$$p_x$$$ is larger than the number on card $$$x$$$, replace the number on card $$$p_x$$$ with the number on card $$$x$$$.  Remove card $$$x$$$.

Initially, $$$w_i = a_i$$$. Pak Chanek can do the following operations in order:  Select card $$$5$$$. Append $$$w_5 = 2$$$ to the end of $$$s$$$.

Alice is allowed to remove any substring of even length (possibly empty) and Bob is allowed to remove any substring of odd length from $$$s$$$.More formally, if there was a string $$$s = s_1s_2 \\ldots s_k$$$ the player can choose a substring $$$s_ls_{l+1} \\ldots s_{r-1}s_r$$$ with length of corresponding parity and remove it. After that the string will become $$$s = s_1 \\ldots s_{l-1}s_{r+1} \\ldots s_k$$$.After the string becomes empty, the round ends and each player calculates his/her score for this round.

You have to process queries of three types:  add a point;  remove a point;  calculate the number of beautiful triples consisting of points belonging to the set. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$q$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\le q, d \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of queries and the parameter for defining if a triple is beautiful, respectively.

The integer $$$a_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th query in the following way:   if the point $$$a_i$$$ belongs to the set, remove it; otherwise, add it;  after adding or removing the point, print the number of beautiful triples. \n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print one integer \u2014 the number of beautiful triples after processing the respective query.\n\nCode:\n\nimport os\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\r\n \r\nBUFSIZE = 8192\r\n \r\n \r\nclass FastIO(IOBase):\r\n    newlines = 0\r\n \r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self._fd = file.fileno()\r\n        self.buffer = BytesIO()\r\n        self.writable = \"x\" in file.mode or \"r\" not in file.mode\r\n        self.write = self.buffer.write if self.writable else None\r\n \r\n    def read(self):\r\n        while True:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            if not b:\r\n                break\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines = 0\r\n        return self.buffer.read()\r\n \r\n    def readline(self):\r\n        while self.newlines == 0:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            self.newlines = b.count(b\"\\n\") + (not b)\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines -= 1\r\n        return self.buffer.readline()\r\n \r\n    def flush(self):\r\n        if self.writable:\r\n            os.write(self._fd, self.buffer.getvalue())\r\n            self.buffer.truncate(0), self.buffer.seek(0)\r\n \r\n \r\nclass IOWrapper(IOBase):\r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self.buffer = FastIO(file)\r\n        self.flush = self.buffer.flush\r\n        self.writable = self.buffer.writable\r\n        self.write = lambda s: self.buffer.write(s.encode(\"ascii\"))\r\n        self.read = lambda: self.buffer.read().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n        self.readline = lambda: self.buffer.readline().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n \r\n \r\nsys.stdin, sys.stdout = IOWrapper(sys.stdin), IOWrapper(sys.stdout)\r\ninput = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip(\"\\r\\n\")\r\n\r\nclass LazySegmentTree():\r\n    def __init__(self, n, op, e, mapping, composition, id):\r\n        self.n = n\r\n        self.op = op\r\n        self.e = e\r\n        self.mapping = mapping\r\n        self.composition = composition\r\n        self.id = id\r\n        self.log = (n -

You have to process queries of three types:  add a point;  remove a point;  calculate the number of beautiful triples consisting of points belonging to the set. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$q$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\le q, d \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of queries and the parameter for defining if a triple is beautiful, respectively.

Monocarp won't add both peppers to any dish, won't add any pepper multiple times, and won't leave any dish without the pepper added.Before adding the pepper, Monocarp should first purchase the said pepper in some shop. There are $$$m$$$ shops in his local area. The $$$j$$$-th of them has packages of red pepper sufficient for $$$x_j$$$ servings and packages of black pepper sufficient for $$$y_j$$$ servings.Monocarp goes to exactly one shop, purchases multiple (possibly, zero) packages of each pepper in such a way that each dish will get the pepper added once, and no pepper is left. More formally, if he purchases $$$x$$$ red pepper packages and $$$y$$$ black pepper packages, then $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ should be non-negative and $$$x \\cdot x_j + y \\cdot y_j$$$ should be equal to $$$n$$$.For each shop, determine the maximum total tastiness of the dishes after Monocarp buys pepper packages only in this shop and adds the pepper to the dishes.

The optimal choice turns out to be either $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ or $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$. Monocarp can add black pepper to the first dish, red pepper to the second dish and any pepper to the third dish, the total is $$$10 + 100 + 2 = 112$$$.In the third shop, Monocarp can only buy $$$1$$$ red pepper package and $$$0$$$ black pepper packages. Red pepper added to all dishes will sum up to $$$5 + 100 + 2 = 107$$$.In the fourth shop, Monocarp can only buy an even total number of packages.

To answer the $$$i$$$-th query, you have to:  add a lantern on coordinate $$$f_i$$$;  calculate the number of valid ways to assign power values to all lanterns, and print it modulo $$$998244353$$$;  remove the lantern you just added. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains three integers $$$d$$$, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$4 \\le d \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 16$$$) \u2014 the size of the segment, the number of lanterns and the number of points of interest, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le d - 1$$$), where $$$l_i$$$ is the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th lantern. The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le d - 1$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point of interest. The fourth line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of queries. The fifth line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_q$$$ ($$$1 \\le f_i \\le d - 1$$$), where $$$f_i$$$ is the integer representing the $$$i$$$-th query. Additional constraint on the input: during the processing of each query, no coordinate contains more than one object (i.\u2009e. there cannot be two or more lanterns with the same coordinate, two or more points of interest with the same coordinate, or a lantern and a point of interest with the same coordinate).\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print one integer \u2014 the answer to it, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\nCode:\n\ninput = __import__('sys').stdin.readline\r\n\r\n\r\nMOD = 998244353\r\n\r\n\r\nd, n, m = map(int, input().split())\r\nlamps = list(sorted(map(int, input().split()))) # n\r\npoints = list(sorted(map(int, input().split()))) # m\r\n\r\n# 1.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Consider a segment $$$[0, d]$$$ of the coordinate line. There are $$$n$$$ lanterns and $$$m$$$ points of interest in this segment.For each lantern, you can choose its power \u2014 an integer between $$$0$$$ and $$$d$$$ (inclusive). A lantern with coordinate $$$x$$$ illuminates the point of interest with coordinate $$$y$$$ if $$$|x - y|$$$ is less than or equal to the power of the lantern.A way to choose the power values for all lanterns is considered valid if every point of interest is illuminated by at least one lantern.You have to process $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is represented by one integer $$$f_i$$$. To answer the $$$i$$$-th query, you have to:  add a lantern on coordinate $$$f_i$$$;  calculate the number of valid ways to assign power values to all lanterns, and print it modulo $$$998244353$$$;  remove the lantern you just added. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains three integers $$$d$$$, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$4 \\le d \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 16$$$) \u2014 the size of the segment, the number of lanterns and the number of points of interest, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le d - 1$$$), where $$$l_i$$$ is the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th lantern. The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le d - 1$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ is the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point of interest. The fourth line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of queries. The fifth line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_q$$$ ($$$1 \\le f_i \\le d - 1$$$), where $$$f_i$$$ is the integer representing the $$$i$$$-th query. Additional constraint on the input: during the processing of each query, no coordinate contains more than one object (i.\u2009e. there cannot be two or more lanterns with the same coordinate, two or more points of interest with the same coordinate, or a lantern and a point of interest with the same coordinate).\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print one integer \u2014 the answer to it, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\nCode:\n\ninput = __import__('sys').stdin.readline\r\n\r\n\r\nMOD = 998244353\r\n\r\n\r\nd, n, m = map(int, input().split())\r\nlamps = list(sorted(map(int, input().split()))) # n\r\npoints = list(sorted(map(int, input().split()))) # m\r\n\r\n# 1.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You have a square chessboard of size $$$n \\times n$$$. Rows are numbered from top to bottom with numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and columns\u00a0\u2014 from left to right with numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. So, each cell is denoted with pair of integers $$$(x, y)$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$), where $$$x$$$ is a row number and $$$y$$$ is a column number.You have to perform $$$q$$$ queries of three types:  Put a new rook in cell $$$(x, y)$$$.  Remove a rook from cell $$$(x, y)$$$. It's guaranteed that the rook was put in this cell before.  Check if each cell of subrectangle $$$(x_1, y_1) - (x_2, y_2)$$$ of the board is attacked by at least one rook. Subrectangle is a set of cells $$$(x, y)$$$ such that for each cell two conditions are satisfied: $$$x_1 \\le x \\le x_2$$$ and $$$y_1 \\le y \\le y_2$$$.Recall that cell $$$(a, b)$$$ is attacked by a rook placed in cell $$$(c, d)$$$ if either $$$a = c$$$ or $$$b = d$$$. In particular, the cell containing a rook is attacked by this rook.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the chessboard and the number of queries, respectively. Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains description of a query. Description begins with integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$$$) which denotes type of a query:   If $$$t = 1$$$, two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ follows ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 coordinated of the cell where the new rook should be put in. It's guaranteed that there is no rook in the cell $$$(x, y)$$$ at the moment of the given query.  If $$$t = 2$$$, two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ follows ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 coordinates of the cell to remove a rook from. It's guaranteed that there is a rook in the cell $$$(x, y)$$$ at the moment of the given query.  If $$$t = 3$$$, four integers $$$x_1, y_1, x_2$$$ and $$$y_2$$$ follows ($$$1 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 subrectangle to check if each cell of it is attacked by at least one rook.  It's guaranteed that among $$$q$$$ queries there is at least one query of the third type.\n\nOutput Specification: Print the answer for each query of the third type in a separate line. Print \"Yes\" (without quotes) if each cell of the subrectangle is attacked by at least one rook. Otherwise print \"No\" (without quotes).\n\nNotes: NoteConsider example.

Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem...Masha has an oriented graph which $$$i$$$-th vertex contains some positive integer $$$a_i$$$. Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex $$$u$$$ to any other vertex $$$v$$$ such that there is an oriented edge $$$u \\to v$$$ in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex $$$i$$$, Masha write down an integer $$$a_i$$$ in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly $$$k - 1$$$ operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{18}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of operation that Masha should make.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: One day Masha was walking in the park and found a graph under a tree... Surprised? Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem...Masha has an oriented graph which $$$i$$$-th vertex contains some positive integer $$$a_i$$$. Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex $$$u$$$ to any other vertex $$$v$$$ such that there is an oriented edge $$$u \\to v$$$ in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex $$$i$$$, Masha write down an integer $$$a_i$$$ in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly $$$k - 1$$$ operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{18}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of operation that Masha should make. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers written in graph vertices. Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u \\ne v \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 it means that there is an edge $$$u \\to v$$$ in the graph. It's guaranteed that graph doesn't contain loops and multi-edges.\n\nOutput Specification: Print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum value of the maximum number that Masha wrote in her notebook during optimal coin movements. If Masha won't be able to perform $$$k - 1$$$ operations, print $$$-1$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteGraph described in the first and the second examples is illustrated below.  In the first example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex $$$1$$$. After that she can perform three operations: $$$1 \\to 3$$$, $$$3 \\to 4$$$ and $$$4 \\to 5$$$. Integers $$$1, 2, 3$$$ and $$$4$$$ will be written in the notepad.In the second example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex $$$2$$$. After that she can perform $$$99$$$ operations: $$$2 \\to 5$$$, $$$5 \\to 6$$$, $$$6 \\to 2$$$, $$$2 \\to 5$$$, and so on.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Mark has just purchased a rack of $$$n$$$ lightbulbs. The state of the lightbulbs can be described with binary string $$$s = s_1s_2\\dots s_n$$$, where $$$s_i=\\texttt{1}$$$ means that the $$$i$$$-th lightbulb is turned on, while $$$s_i=\\texttt{0}$$$ means that the $$$i$$$-th lightbulb is turned off.Unfortunately, the lightbulbs are broken, and the only operation he can perform to change the state of the lightbulbs is the following:  Select an index $$$i$$$ from $$$2,3,\\dots,n-1$$$ such that $$$s_{i-1}\\ne s_{i+1}$$$.  Toggle $$$s_i$$$. Namely, if $$$s_i$$$ is $$$\\texttt{0}$$$, set $$$s_i$$$ to $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ or vice versa. Mark wants the state of the lightbulbs to be another binary string $$$t$$$. Help Mark determine the minimum number of operations to do so.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\leq q\\leq 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

The third line of each test case contains a binary string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ \u2014 the final state of the lightbulbs. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case, print a line containing the minimum number of operations Mark needs to perform to transform $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$. If there is no such sequence of operations, print $$$-1$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first test case, one sequence of operations that achieves the minimum number of operations is the following.   Select $$$i=3$$$, changing $$$\\texttt{01}\\color{red}{\\texttt{0}}\\texttt{0}$$$ to $$$\\texttt{01}\\color{red}{\\texttt{1}}\\texttt{0}$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: After watching a certain anime before going to sleep, Mark dreams of standing in an old classroom with a blackboard that has a sequence of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ on it.Then, professor Koro comes in. He can perform the following operation:  select an integer $$$x$$$ that appears at least $$$2$$$ times on the board,  erase those $$$2$$$ appearances, and  write $$$x+1$$$ on the board. Professor Koro then asks Mark the question, \"what is the maximum possible number that could appear on the board after some operations?\"Mark quickly solves this question, but he is still slower than professor Koro. Thus, professor Koro decides to give Mark additional challenges. He will update the initial sequence of integers $$$q$$$ times. Each time, he will choose positive integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$, then change $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$. After each update, he will ask Mark the same question again.Help Mark answer these questions faster than Professor Koro!Note that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the sequence $$$a$$$ will apply when processing future updates.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq q\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number of updates, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) Then, $$$q$$$ lines follow, each consisting of two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$1\\leq k\\leq n$$$, $$$1\\leq l\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), telling to update $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should consist of a single integer \u2014 the answer after the $$$i$$$-th update.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example test, the program must proceed through $$$4$$$ updates.The sequence after the first update is $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$. One sequence of operations that achieves the number $$$6$$$ the following.   Initially, the blackboard has numbers $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,5,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[4,5,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[5,\\color{red}{5}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$5$$$ and write $$$6$$$, yielding $$$[\\color{red}{6}]$$$. Then, in the second update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$. This time, Mark cannot achieve $$$6$$$. However, one sequence that Mark can use to achieve $$$5$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,3,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[3,\\color{red}{5}]$$$. In the third update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$. One way to achieve $$$4$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[2,2,1,\\color{red}{4}]$$$. \n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\nimport os\r\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\r\n\r\n# region fastio\r\nBUFSIZE = 8192\r\n \r\nclass FastIO(IOBase):\r\n    newlines = 0\r\n \r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self._fd = file.fileno()\r\n        self.buffer = BytesIO()\r\n        self.writable = \"x\" in file.mode or \"r\" not in file.mode\r\n        self.write = self.buffer.write if self.writable else None\r\n \r\n    def read(self):\r\n        while True:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            if not b:\r\n                break\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines = 0\r\n        return self.buffer.read()\r\n \r\n    def readline(self):\r\n        while self.newlines == 0:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            self.newlines = b.count(b\"\\n\") + (not b)\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines -= 1\r\n        return self.buffer.readline()\r\n \r\n    def flush(self):\r\n        if self.writable:\r\n            os.write(self._fd, self.buffer.getvalue())\r\n            self.buffer.truncate(0), self.buffer.seek(0)\r\n \r\nclass IOWrapper(IOBase):\r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self.buffer = FastIO(file)\r\n        self.flush = self.buffer.flush\r\n        self.writable = self.buffer.writable\r\n        self.write = lambda s: self.buffer.write(s.encode(\"ascii\"))\r\n        self.read = lambda: self.buffer.read().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n        self.readline = lambda: self.buffer.readline().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n\r\nif sys.version_info[0] < 3:\r\n    sys.stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))\r\nelse:\r\n    sys.stdin, sys.stdout = IOWrapper(sys.stdin), IOWrapper(sys.stdout)\r\n\r\nfile = sys.stdin\r\nif os.environ.get('USER') == \"loic\":\r\n    file = open(\"data.in\")\r\n    \r\nline = lambda: file.readline().split()\r\nui = lambda: int(line()[0])\r\nti = lambda: map(int,line())\r\nli = lambda: list(ti())\r\n\r\n#######################################################################\r\n\r\nclass BitSet:\r\n\r\n    ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD = 6\r\n    BITS_PER_WORD = 1 << ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD\r\n    WORD_MASK = -1\r\n    \r\n    def __init__(self, sz):\r\n        self.sz = sz\r\n        self.words = [0] * (self._wordIndex(sz -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: After watching a certain anime before going to sleep, Mark dreams of standing in an old classroom with a blackboard that has a sequence of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ on it.Then, professor Koro comes in. He can perform the following operation:  select an integer $$$x$$$ that appears at least $$$2$$$ times on the board,  erase those $$$2$$$ appearances, and  write $$$x+1$$$ on the board. Professor Koro then asks Mark the question, \"what is the maximum possible number that could appear on the board after some operations?\"Mark quickly solves this question, but he is still slower than professor Koro. Thus, professor Koro decides to give Mark additional challenges. He will update the initial sequence of integers $$$q$$$ times. Each time, he will choose positive integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$, then change $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$. After each update, he will ask Mark the same question again.Help Mark answer these questions faster than Professor Koro!Note that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the sequence $$$a$$$ will apply when processing future updates.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq q\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number of updates, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) Then, $$$q$$$ lines follow, each consisting of two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$1\\leq k\\leq n$$$, $$$1\\leq l\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), telling to update $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should consist of a single integer \u2014 the answer after the $$$i$$$-th update.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example test, the program must proceed through $$$4$$$ updates.The sequence after the first update is $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$. One sequence of operations that achieves the number $$$6$$$ the following.   Initially, the blackboard has numbers $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,5,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[4,5,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[5,\\color{red}{5}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$5$$$ and write $$$6$$$, yielding $$$[\\color{red}{6}]$$$. Then, in the second update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$. This time, Mark cannot achieve $$$6$$$. However, one sequence that Mark can use to achieve $$$5$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,3,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[3,\\color{red}{5}]$$$. In the third update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$. One way to achieve $$$4$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[2,2,1,\\color{red}{4}]$$$. \n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\nimport os\r\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\r\n\r\n# region fastio\r\nBUFSIZE = 8192\r\n \r\nclass FastIO(IOBase):\r\n    newlines = 0\r\n \r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self._fd = file.fileno()\r\n        self.buffer = BytesIO()\r\n        self.writable = \"x\" in file.mode or \"r\" not in file.mode\r\n        self.write = self.buffer.write if self.writable else None\r\n \r\n    def read(self):\r\n        while True:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            if not b:\r\n                break\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines = 0\r\n        return self.buffer.read()\r\n \r\n    def readline(self):\r\n        while self.newlines == 0:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            self.newlines = b.count(b\"\\n\") + (not b)\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines -= 1\r\n        return self.buffer.readline()\r\n \r\n    def flush(self):\r\n        if self.writable:\r\n            os.write(self._fd, self.buffer.getvalue())\r\n            self.buffer.truncate(0), self.buffer.seek(0)\r\n \r\nclass IOWrapper(IOBase):\r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self.buffer = FastIO(file)\r\n        self.flush = self.buffer.flush\r\n        self.writable = self.buffer.writable\r\n        self.write = lambda s: self.buffer.write(s.encode(\"ascii\"))\r\n        self.read = lambda: self.buffer.read().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n        self.readline = lambda: self.buffer.readline().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n\r\nif sys.version_info[0] < 3:\r\n    sys.stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))\r\nelse:\r\n    sys.stdin, sys.stdout = IOWrapper(sys.stdin), IOWrapper(sys.stdout)\r\n\r\nfile = sys.stdin\r\nif os.environ.get('USER') == \"loic\":\r\n    file = open(\"data.in\")\r\n    \r\nline = lambda: file.readline().split()\r\nui = lambda: int(line()[0])\r\nti = lambda: map(int,line())\r\nli = lambda: list(ti())\r\n\r\n#######################################################################\r\n\r\nclass BitSet:\r\n\r\n    ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD = 6\r\n    BITS_PER_WORD = 1 << ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD\r\n    WORD_MASK = -1\r\n    \r\n    def __init__(self, sz):\r\n        self.sz = sz\r\n        self.words = [0] * (self._wordIndex(sz -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: After watching a certain anime before going to sleep, Mark dreams of standing in an old classroom with a blackboard that has a sequence of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ on it.Then, professor Koro comes in. He can perform the following operation:  select an integer $$$x$$$ that appears at least $$$2$$$ times on the board,  erase those $$$2$$$ appearances, and  write $$$x+1$$$ on the board. Professor Koro then asks Mark the question, \"what is the maximum possible number that could appear on the board after some operations?\"Mark quickly solves this question, but he is still slower than professor Koro. Thus, professor Koro decides to give Mark additional challenges. He will update the initial sequence of integers $$$q$$$ times. Each time, he will choose positive integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$, then change $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$. After each update, he will ask Mark the same question again.Help Mark answer these questions faster than Professor Koro!Note that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the sequence $$$a$$$ will apply when processing future updates.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq q\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number of updates, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) Then, $$$q$$$ lines follow, each consisting of two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$1\\leq k\\leq n$$$, $$$1\\leq l\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), telling to update $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should consist of a single integer \u2014 the answer after the $$$i$$$-th update.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example test, the program must proceed through $$$4$$$ updates.The sequence after the first update is $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$. One sequence of operations that achieves the number $$$6$$$ the following.   Initially, the blackboard has numbers $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,5,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[4,5,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[5,\\color{red}{5}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$5$$$ and write $$$6$$$, yielding $$$[\\color{red}{6}]$$$. Then, in the second update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$. This time, Mark cannot achieve $$$6$$$. However, one sequence that Mark can use to achieve $$$5$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,3,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[3,\\color{red}{5}]$$$. In the third update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$. One way to achieve $$$4$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[2,2,1,\\color{red}{4}]$$$. \n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\nimport os\r\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\r\n\r\n# region fastio\r\nBUFSIZE = 8192\r\n \r\nclass FastIO(IOBase):\r\n    newlines = 0\r\n \r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self._fd = file.fileno()\r\n        self.buffer = BytesIO()\r\n        self.writable = \"x\" in file.mode or \"r\" not in file.mode\r\n        self.write = self.buffer.write if self.writable else None\r\n \r\n    def read(self):\r\n        while True:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            if not b:\r\n                break\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines = 0\r\n        return self.buffer.read()\r\n \r\n    def readline(self):\r\n        while self.newlines == 0:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            self.newlines = b.count(b\"\\n\") + (not b)\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines -= 1\r\n        return self.buffer.readline()\r\n \r\n    def flush(self):\r\n        if self.writable:\r\n            os.write(self._fd, self.buffer.getvalue())\r\n            self.buffer.truncate(0), self.buffer.seek(0)\r\n \r\nclass IOWrapper(IOBase):\r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self.buffer = FastIO(file)\r\n        self.flush = self.buffer.flush\r\n        self.writable = self.buffer.writable\r\n        self.write = lambda s: self.buffer.write(s.encode(\"ascii\"))\r\n        self.read = lambda: self.buffer.read().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n        self.readline = lambda: self.buffer.readline().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n\r\nif sys.version_info[0] < 3:\r\n    sys.stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))\r\nelse:\r\n    sys.stdin, sys.stdout = IOWrapper(sys.stdin), IOWrapper(sys.stdout)\r\n\r\nfile = sys.stdin\r\nif os.environ.get('USER') == \"loic\":\r\n    file = open(\"data.in\")\r\n    \r\nline = lambda: file.readline().split()\r\nui = lambda: int(line()[0])\r\nti = lambda: map(int,line())\r\nli = lambda: list(ti())\r\n\r\n#######################################################################\r\n\r\nclass BitSet:\r\n\r\n    ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD = 6\r\n    WORD_SZ = 1 << ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD\r\n    MASK = -0x1\r\n    MASK_MAX = 0x7fffffffffffffff\r\n    MASK_MIN = ~MASK_MAX\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, sz):\r\n        self.sz = sz\r\n        self.words = [0] * (self._wordIndex(sz -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: After watching a certain anime before going to sleep, Mark dreams of standing in an old classroom with a blackboard that has a sequence of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ on it.Then, professor Koro comes in. He can perform the following operation:  select an integer $$$x$$$ that appears at least $$$2$$$ times on the board,  erase those $$$2$$$ appearances, and  write $$$x+1$$$ on the board. Professor Koro then asks Mark the question, \"what is the maximum possible number that could appear on the board after some operations?\"Mark quickly solves this question, but he is still slower than professor Koro. Thus, professor Koro decides to give Mark additional challenges. He will update the initial sequence of integers $$$q$$$ times. Each time, he will choose positive integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$, then change $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$. After each update, he will ask Mark the same question again.Help Mark answer these questions faster than Professor Koro!Note that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the sequence $$$a$$$ will apply when processing future updates.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq q\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number of updates, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) Then, $$$q$$$ lines follow, each consisting of two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$1\\leq k\\leq n$$$, $$$1\\leq l\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), telling to update $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should consist of a single integer \u2014 the answer after the $$$i$$$-th update.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example test, the program must proceed through $$$4$$$ updates.The sequence after the first update is $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$. One sequence of operations that achieves the number $$$6$$$ the following.   Initially, the blackboard has numbers $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,5,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[4,5,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[5,\\color{red}{5}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$5$$$ and write $$$6$$$, yielding $$$[\\color{red}{6}]$$$. Then, in the second update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$. This time, Mark cannot achieve $$$6$$$. However, one sequence that Mark can use to achieve $$$5$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,3,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[3,\\color{red}{5}]$$$. In the third update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$. One way to achieve $$$4$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[2,2,1,\\color{red}{4}]$$$. \n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\nimport os\r\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\r\n\r\n# region fastio\r\nBUFSIZE = 8192\r\n \r\nclass FastIO(IOBase):\r\n    newlines = 0\r\n \r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self._fd = file.fileno()\r\n        self.buffer = BytesIO()\r\n        self.writable = \"x\" in file.mode or \"r\" not in file.mode\r\n        self.write = self.buffer.write if self.writable else None\r\n \r\n    def read(self):\r\n        while True:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            if not b:\r\n                break\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines = 0\r\n        return self.buffer.read()\r\n \r\n    def readline(self):\r\n        while self.newlines == 0:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            self.newlines = b.count(b\"\\n\") + (not b)\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines -= 1\r\n        return self.buffer.readline()\r\n \r\n    def flush(self):\r\n        if self.writable:\r\n            os.write(self._fd, self.buffer.getvalue())\r\n            self.buffer.truncate(0), self.buffer.seek(0)\r\n \r\nclass IOWrapper(IOBase):\r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self.buffer = FastIO(file)\r\n        self.flush = self.buffer.flush\r\n        self.writable = self.buffer.writable\r\n        self.write = lambda s: self.buffer.write(s.encode(\"ascii\"))\r\n        self.read = lambda: self.buffer.read().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n        self.readline = lambda: self.buffer.readline().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n\r\nif sys.version_info[0] < 3:\r\n    sys.stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))\r\nelse:\r\n    sys.stdin, sys.stdout = IOWrapper(sys.stdin), IOWrapper(sys.stdout)\r\n\r\nfile = sys.stdin\r\nif os.environ.get('USER') == \"loic\":\r\n    file = open(\"data.in\")\r\n    \r\nline = lambda: file.readline().split()\r\nui = lambda: int(line()[0])\r\nti = lambda: map(int,line())\r\nli = lambda: list(ti())\r\n\r\n#######################################################################\r\n\r\nclass BitSet:\r\n\r\n    ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD = 6\r\n    WORD_SZ = 1 << ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD\r\n    MASK = -0x1\r\n    MASK_MAX = 0x7fffffffffffffff\r\n    MASK_MIN = ~MASK_MAX\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, sz):\r\n        self.sz = sz\r\n        self.words = [0] * (self._wordIndex(sz -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: After watching a certain anime before going to sleep, Mark dreams of standing in an old classroom with a blackboard that has a sequence of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ on it.Then, professor Koro comes in. He can perform the following operation:  select an integer $$$x$$$ that appears at least $$$2$$$ times on the board,  erase those $$$2$$$ appearances, and  write $$$x+1$$$ on the board. Professor Koro then asks Mark the question, \"what is the maximum possible number that could appear on the board after some operations?\"Mark quickly solves this question, but he is still slower than professor Koro. Thus, professor Koro decides to give Mark additional challenges. He will update the initial sequence of integers $$$q$$$ times. Each time, he will choose positive integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$, then change $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$. After each update, he will ask Mark the same question again.Help Mark answer these questions faster than Professor Koro!Note that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the sequence $$$a$$$ will apply when processing future updates.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq q\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number of updates, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) Then, $$$q$$$ lines follow, each consisting of two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$1\\leq k\\leq n$$$, $$$1\\leq l\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), telling to update $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should consist of a single integer \u2014 the answer after the $$$i$$$-th update.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example test, the program must proceed through $$$4$$$ updates.The sequence after the first update is $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$. One sequence of operations that achieves the number $$$6$$$ the following.   Initially, the blackboard has numbers $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,5,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[4,5,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[5,\\color{red}{5}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$5$$$ and write $$$6$$$, yielding $$$[\\color{red}{6}]$$$. Then, in the second update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$. This time, Mark cannot achieve $$$6$$$. However, one sequence that Mark can use to achieve $$$5$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,3,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[3,\\color{red}{5}]$$$. In the third update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$. One way to achieve $$$4$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[2,2,1,\\color{red}{4}]$$$. \n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\nimport os\r\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\r\n\r\n# region fastio\r\nBUFSIZE = 8192\r\n \r\nclass FastIO(IOBase):\r\n    newlines = 0\r\n \r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self._fd = file.fileno()\r\n        self.buffer = BytesIO()\r\n        self.writable = \"x\" in file.mode or \"r\" not in file.mode\r\n        self.write = self.buffer.write if self.writable else None\r\n \r\n    def read(self):\r\n        while True:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            if not b:\r\n                break\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines = 0\r\n        return self.buffer.read()\r\n \r\n    def readline(self):\r\n        while self.newlines == 0:\r\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\r\n            self.newlines = b.count(b\"\\n\") + (not b)\r\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\r\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\r\n        self.newlines -= 1\r\n        return self.buffer.readline()\r\n \r\n    def flush(self):\r\n        if self.writable:\r\n            os.write(self._fd, self.buffer.getvalue())\r\n            self.buffer.truncate(0), self.buffer.seek(0)\r\n \r\nclass IOWrapper(IOBase):\r\n    def __init__(self, file):\r\n        self.buffer = FastIO(file)\r\n        self.flush = self.buffer.flush\r\n        self.writable = self.buffer.writable\r\n        self.write = lambda s: self.buffer.write(s.encode(\"ascii\"))\r\n        self.read = lambda: self.buffer.read().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n        self.readline = lambda: self.buffer.readline().decode(\"ascii\")\r\n\r\nif sys.version_info[0] < 3:\r\n    sys.stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))\r\nelse:\r\n    sys.stdin, sys.stdout = IOWrapper(sys.stdin), IOWrapper(sys.stdout)\r\n\r\nfile = sys.stdin\r\nif os.environ.get('USER') == \"loic\":\r\n    file = open(\"data.in\")\r\n    \r\nline = lambda: file.readline().split()\r\nui = lambda: int(line()[0])\r\nti = lambda: map(int,line())\r\nli = lambda: list(ti())\r\n\r\n#######################################################################\r\n\r\nclass BitSet:\r\n\r\n    ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD = 6\r\n    WORD_SZ = 60#1 << ADDRESS_BITS_PER_WORD\r\n    MASK = 0xfffffffffffffff\r\n    \r\n    def __init__(self, sz):\r\n        self.sz = sz\r\n        self.words = [0] * (self._wordIndex(sz -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: After watching a certain anime before going to sleep, Mark dreams of standing in an old classroom with a blackboard that has a sequence of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ on it.Then, professor Koro comes in. He can perform the following operation:  select an integer $$$x$$$ that appears at least $$$2$$$ times on the board,  erase those $$$2$$$ appearances, and  write $$$x+1$$$ on the board. Professor Koro then asks Mark the question, \"what is the maximum possible number that could appear on the board after some operations?\"Mark quickly solves this question, but he is still slower than professor Koro. Thus, professor Koro decides to give Mark additional challenges. He will update the initial sequence of integers $$$q$$$ times. Each time, he will choose positive integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$, then change $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$. After each update, he will ask Mark the same question again.Help Mark answer these questions faster than Professor Koro!Note that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the sequence $$$a$$$ will apply when processing future updates.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq q\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number of updates, respectively. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) Then, $$$q$$$ lines follow, each consisting of two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$l$$$ ($$$1\\leq k\\leq n$$$, $$$1\\leq l\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), telling to update $$$a_k$$$ to $$$l$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should consist of a single integer \u2014 the answer after the $$$i$$$-th update.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example test, the program must proceed through $$$4$$$ updates.The sequence after the first update is $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$. One sequence of operations that achieves the number $$$6$$$ the following.   Initially, the blackboard has numbers $$$[2,3,2,4,5]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,5,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[4,5,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[5,\\color{red}{5}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$5$$$ and write $$$6$$$, yielding $$$[\\color{red}{6}]$$$. Then, in the second update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$. This time, Mark cannot achieve $$$6$$$. However, one sequence that Mark can use to achieve $$$5$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,4,3]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$2$$$ and write $$$3$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,3,\\color{red}{3}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$3$$$ and write $$$4$$$, yielding $$$[3,4,\\color{red}{4}]$$$.  Erase two copies of $$$4$$$ and write $$$5$$$, yielding $$$[3,\\color{red}{5}]$$$. In the third update, the array is changed to $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$. One way to achieve $$$4$$$ is shown below.   Initially, the blackboard has $$$[2,3,2,1,3]$$$.

For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).Baby Hosssam forgot about the pizza and started playing around with the two permutations. While he was playing with them, some elements of the first permutation got mixed up with some elements of the second permutation, and to his surprise those elements also formed a permutation of size $$$n$$$.Specifically, he mixed up the permutations to form a new array $$$c$$$ in the following way.  For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$), he either made $$$c_i=a_i$$$ or $$$c_i=b_i$$$.  The array $$$c$$$ is a permutation. You know permutations $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and values at some positions in $$$c$$$.

For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).Baby Hosssam forgot about the pizza and started playing around with the two permutations. While he was playing with them, some elements of the first permutation got mixed up with some elements of the second permutation, and to his surprise those elements also formed a permutation of size $$$n$$$.Specifically, he mixed up the permutations to form a new array $$$c$$$ in the following way.  For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$), he either made $$$c_i=a_i$$$ or $$$c_i=b_i$$$.  The array $$$c$$$ is a permutation.

For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).Baby Hosssam forgot about the pizza and started playing around with the two permutations. While he was playing with them, some elements of the first permutation got mixed up with some elements of the second permutation, and to his surprise those elements also formed a permutation of size $$$n$$$.Specifically, he mixed up the permutations to form a new array $$$c$$$ in the following way.  For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$), he either made $$$c_i=a_i$$$ or $$$c_i=b_i$$$.  The array $$$c$$$ is a permutation. You know permutations $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and values at some positions in $$$c$$$.

He was given an easy online assessment to solve before joining the GIU. Citizens of the GUC were happy sad to see the prof leaving, so they decided to hack into the system and change the online assessment into a harder one so that he stays at the GUC. After a long argument, they decided to change it into the following problem.Given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$, where $$$a_{i} \\neq 0$$$, check if you can make this array sorted by using the following operation any number of times (possibly zero). An array is sorted if its elements are arranged in a non-decreasing order.  select two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i,j \\le n$$$) such that $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ have different signs. In other words, one must be positive and one must be negative.  swap the signs of $$$a_{i}$$$ and $$$a_{j}$$$. For example if you select $$$a_i=3$$$ and $$$a_j=-2$$$, then they will change to $$$a_i=-3$$$ and $$$a_j=2$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You have been invited as a production process optimization specialist to some very large company. The company has $$$n$$$ machines at its factory, standing one behind another in the production chain. Each machine can be described in one of the following two ways: $$$(+,~a_i)$$$ or $$$(*,~a_i)$$$.If a workpiece with the value $$$x$$$ is supplied to the machine of kind $$$(+,~a_i)$$$, then the output workpiece has value $$$x + a_i$$$.If a workpiece with the value $$$x$$$ is supplied to the machine of kind $$$(*,~a_i)$$$, then the output workpiece has value $$$x \\cdot a_i$$$.The whole production process is as follows. The workpiece with the value $$$1$$$ is supplied to the first machine, then the workpiece obtained after the operation of the first machine is supplied to the second machine, then the workpiece obtained after the operation of the second machine is supplied to the third machine, and so on. The company is not doing very well, so now the value of the resulting product does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^9$$$.The directors of the company are not satisfied with the efficiency of the production process and have given you a budget of $$$b$$$ coins to optimize it.To optimize production you can change the order of machines in the chain. Namely, by spending $$$p$$$ coins, you can take any machine of kind $$$(+,~a_i)$$$ and move it to any place in the chain without changing the order of other machines. Also, by spending $$$m$$$ coins, you can take any machine of kind $$$(*,~a_i)$$$ and move it to any place in the chain.What is the maximum value of the resulting product that can be achieved if the total cost of movements that are made should not exceed $$$b$$$ coins?\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$p$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le b, p, m \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of machine at the factory, your budget and costs of movements of both kinds of machines. Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains description of a machine. The description begins with one of the following characters: \"+\" or \"*\", that denotes the kind of the machine. Then an integer $$$a_i$$$ follows ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$$$). It's guaranteed that the current value of the resulting product does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^9$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum value of the resulting product that can be achieved if the total cost of movements that are made does not exceed $$$b$$$ coins.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example our budget is too low to move machine $$$(*,~2)$$$, but we can move both machines $$$(+,~1)$$$ to the beginning of the chain. So the final chain will be $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(*,~2)$$$. If the workpiece with the value $$$1$$$ is supplied to the first machine, its value will be changed in the following way: $$$1, 2, 3, 6$$$.In the second example we can move only one machine. Let's move machine $$$(+,~2)$$$ to the beginning of the chain. The final chain will be $$$(+,~2)$$$ $$$(*,~2)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(*,~3)$$$. The value of the workpiece will be changed in the following way: $$$1, 3, 6, 7, 21$$$.In the third example we can place machine $$$(*,~4)$$$ before the machine $$$(*,~5)$$$, and move machine $$$(+,~3)$$$ to the beginning of the chain. The final chain will be $$$(+,~3)$$$ $$$(*,~2)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(*,~4)$$$ $$$(*,~5)$$$. The value of the workpiece will be changed in the following way: $$$1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 48, 240$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nfrom bisect import bisect\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\r\n\r\nn, b, p, m = map(int, input().split())\r\n\r\n\r\nadds = []\r\ncurr = []\r\nmults = []\r\n\r\ni = 0\r\nfor _ in range(n):\r\n    t, v = input().split()\r\n    v = int(v)\r\n    \r\n    if t == '*':\r\n        if v == 1:\r\n            continue\r\n        curr.sort()\r\n\r\n        adds.append(curr)\r\n        mults.append(v)\r\n        curr = []\r\n    else:\r\n        curr.append(v)\r\n        \r\ncurr.sort()\r\nadds.append(curr)\r\n\r\npref = []\r\nfor l in adds:  \r\n    np = [0]\r\n    for v in l[::-1]:\r\n        np.append(v + np[-1])\r\n    pref.append(np)\r\n\r\ny = len(mults)\r\nun_m = sorted(set(mults))\r\nz = len(un_m)\r\nct_m = [0] * z\r\nfor v in mults:\r\n    for i in range(z):\r\n        if un_m[i] == v:\r\n            ct_m[i] += 1\r\n\r\nfrom itertools import product\r\nposs = []\r\n\r\nassert len(adds) == y + 1\r\n\r\nfor tup in product(*[range(ct + 1) for ct in ct_m]):\r\n    rem_adds = (b -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You have been invited as a production process optimization specialist to some very large company. The company has $$$n$$$ machines at its factory, standing one behind another in the production chain. Each machine can be described in one of the following two ways: $$$(+,~a_i)$$$ or $$$(*,~a_i)$$$.If a workpiece with the value $$$x$$$ is supplied to the machine of kind $$$(+,~a_i)$$$, then the output workpiece has value $$$x + a_i$$$.If a workpiece with the value $$$x$$$ is supplied to the machine of kind $$$(*,~a_i)$$$, then the output workpiece has value $$$x \\cdot a_i$$$.The whole production process is as follows. The workpiece with the value $$$1$$$ is supplied to the first machine, then the workpiece obtained after the operation of the first machine is supplied to the second machine, then the workpiece obtained after the operation of the second machine is supplied to the third machine, and so on. The company is not doing very well, so now the value of the resulting product does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^9$$$.The directors of the company are not satisfied with the efficiency of the production process and have given you a budget of $$$b$$$ coins to optimize it.To optimize production you can change the order of machines in the chain. Namely, by spending $$$p$$$ coins, you can take any machine of kind $$$(+,~a_i)$$$ and move it to any place in the chain without changing the order of other machines. Also, by spending $$$m$$$ coins, you can take any machine of kind $$$(*,~a_i)$$$ and move it to any place in the chain.What is the maximum value of the resulting product that can be achieved if the total cost of movements that are made should not exceed $$$b$$$ coins?\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$p$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le b, p, m \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of machine at the factory, your budget and costs of movements of both kinds of machines. Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains description of a machine. The description begins with one of the following characters: \"+\" or \"*\", that denotes the kind of the machine. Then an integer $$$a_i$$$ follows ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$$$). It's guaranteed that the current value of the resulting product does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^9$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum value of the resulting product that can be achieved if the total cost of movements that are made does not exceed $$$b$$$ coins.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example our budget is too low to move machine $$$(*,~2)$$$, but we can move both machines $$$(+,~1)$$$ to the beginning of the chain. So the final chain will be $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(*,~2)$$$. If the workpiece with the value $$$1$$$ is supplied to the first machine, its value will be changed in the following way: $$$1, 2, 3, 6$$$.In the second example we can move only one machine. Let's move machine $$$(+,~2)$$$ to the beginning of the chain. The final chain will be $$$(+,~2)$$$ $$$(*,~2)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(*,~3)$$$. The value of the workpiece will be changed in the following way: $$$1, 3, 6, 7, 21$$$.In the third example we can place machine $$$(*,~4)$$$ before the machine $$$(*,~5)$$$, and move machine $$$(+,~3)$$$ to the beginning of the chain. The final chain will be $$$(+,~3)$$$ $$$(*,~2)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(+,~1)$$$ $$$(*,~4)$$$ $$$(*,~5)$$$. The value of the workpiece will be changed in the following way: $$$1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 48, 240$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nfrom bisect import bisect\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\r\n\r\nn, b, p, m = map(int, input().split())\r\n\r\n\r\nadds = []\r\ncurr = []\r\nmults = []\r\n\r\ni = 0\r\nfor _ in range(n):\r\n    t, v = input().split()\r\n    v = int(v)\r\n    \r\n    if t == '*':\r\n        if v == 1:\r\n            continue\r\n        curr.sort()\r\n\r\n        adds.append(curr)\r\n        mults.append(v)\r\n        curr = []\r\n    else:\r\n        curr.append(v)\r\n        \r\ncurr.sort()\r\nadds.append(curr)\r\n\r\npref = []\r\nfor l in adds:  \r\n    np = [0]\r\n    for v in l[::-1]:\r\n        np.append(v + np[-1])\r\n    pref.append(np)\r\n\r\ny = len(mults)\r\nun_m = sorted(set(mults))\r\nz = len(un_m)\r\nct_m = [0] * z\r\nfor v in mults:\r\n    for i in range(z):\r\n        if # TODO: Your code here\r\n            ct_m[i] += 1\r\n\r\nfrom itertools import product\r\nposs = []\r\n\r\nassert len(adds) == y + 1\r\n\r\nfor tup in product(*[range(ct + 1) for ct in ct_m]):\r\n    rem_adds = (b -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: We call an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ fancy if for each $$$1 &lt; i \\le n$$$ it holds that $$$a_i = a_{i-1} + 1$$$.Let's call $$$f(p)$$$ applied to a permutation$$$^\\dagger$$$ of length $$$n$$$ as the minimum number of subarrays it can be partitioned such that each one of them is fancy. For example $$$f([1,2,3]) = 1$$$, while $$$f([3,1,2]) = 2$$$ and $$$f([3,2,1]) = 3$$$.Given $$$n$$$ and a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, we define a permutation $$$p'$$$ of length $$$n$$$ to be $$$k$$$-special if and only if:  $$$p'$$$ is lexicographically smaller$$$^\\ddagger$$$ than $$$p$$$, and  $$$f(p') = k$$$. Your task is to count for each $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$ the number of $$$k$$$-special permutations modulo $$$m$$$.$$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).$$$^\\ddagger$$$ A permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a permutation $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ if and only if the following holds: in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the permutation $$$a$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2000$$$, $$$10 \\le m \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the length of the permutation and the required modulo. The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) \u2014 the permutation $$$p$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$k$$$-th integer is the number of $$$k$$$-special permutations modulo $$$m$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example, the permutations that are lexicographically smaller than $$$[1,3,4,2]$$$ are:  $$$[1,2,3,4]$$$, $$$f([1,2,3,4])=1$$$;  $$$[1,2,4,3]$$$, $$$f([1,2,4,3])=3$$$;  $$$[1,3,2,4]$$$, $$$f([1,3,2,4])=4$$$. Thus our answer is $$$[1,0,1,1]$$$.In the second example, the permutations that are lexicographically smaller than $$$[3,2,1]$$$ are:  $$$[1,2,3]$$$, $$$f([1,2,3])=1$$$;  $$$[1,3,2]$$$, $$$f([1,3,2])=3$$$;  $$$[2,1,3]$$$, $$$f([2,1,3])=3$$$;  $$$[2,3,1]$$$, $$$f([2,3,1])=2$$$;  $$$[3,1,2]$$$, $$$f([3,1,2])=2$$$. Thus our answer is $$$[1,2,2]$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\r\n\r\ndef modmul(a, b, c = 0):\r\n    return (a * b + c) % m\r\n\r\n\r\ncomb = [[1]]\r\nfor i in range(2010):\r\n    prev = comb[-1]\r\n    nex = [1]\r\n    for i in range(i):\r\n        nex.append((prev[i] + prev[i + 1]) % m)\r\n    nex.append(1)\r\n    comb.append(nex)\r\n\r\nfact = [1]\r\nfor i in range(1, 3000):\r\n    fact.append((i * fact[i -

For example $$$f([1,2,3]) = 1$$$, while $$$f([3,1,2]) = 2$$$ and $$$f([3,2,1]) = 3$$$.Given $$$n$$$ and a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$, we define a permutation $$$p'$$$ of length $$$n$$$ to be $$$k$$$-special if and only if:  $$$p'$$$ is lexicographically smaller$$$^\\ddagger$$$ than $$$p$$$, and  $$$f(p') = k$$$. Your task is to count for each $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$ the number of $$$k$$$-special permutations modulo $$$m$$$.$$$^\\dagger$$$ A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).$$$^\\ddagger$$$ A permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a permutation $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ if and only if the following holds: in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the permutation $$$a$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2000$$$, $$$10 \\le m \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the length of the permutation and the required modulo.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You are given a connected undirected graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. The weight of the $$$i$$$-th edge is $$$i$$$.Here is a wrong algorithm of finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph:vis := an array of length ns := a set of edgesfunction dfs(u):    vis[u] := true    iterate through each edge (u, v) in the order from smallest to largest edge weight        if vis[v] = false            add edge (u, v) into the set (s)            dfs(v)function findMST(u):    reset all elements of (vis) to false    reset the edge set (s) to empty    dfs(u)    return the edge set (s)Each of the calls findMST(1), findMST(2), ..., findMST(n) gives you a spanning tree of the graph. Determine which of these trees are minimum spanning trees.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 10^5$$$, $$$n-1\\le m\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph. Each of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1\\le u_i, v_i\\le n$$$, $$$u_i\\ne v_i$$$), describing an undirected edge $$$(u_i,v_i)$$$ in the graph. The $$$i$$$-th edge in the input has weight $$$i$$$. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.\n\nOutput Specification: You need to output a binary string $$$s$$$, where $$$s_i=1$$$ if findMST(i) creates an MST, and $$$s_i = 0$$$ otherwise.\n\nNotes: NoteHere is the graph given in the first example.  There is only one minimum spanning tree in this graph. A minimum spanning tree is $$$(1,2),(3,5),(1,3),(2,4)$$$ which has weight $$$1+2+3+5=11$$$.Here is a part of the process of calling findMST(1):  reset the array vis and the edge set s;  calling dfs(1);  vis[1] := true;  iterate through each edge $$$(1,2),(1,3)$$$;  add edge $$$(1,2)$$$ into the edge set s, calling dfs(2):   vis[2] := true  iterate through each edge $$$(2,1),(2,3),(2,4)$$$;  because vis[1] = true, ignore the edge $$$(2,1)$$$;  add edge $$$(2,3)$$$ into the edge set s, calling dfs(3):   ...

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: This is the hard version of this problem. In this version, we have queries. Note that we do not have multiple test cases in this version. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.An array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ is good if for all $$$i$$$ the $$$i$$$-th element is greater than or equal to $$$i$$$. In other words, $$$b$$$ is good if and only if $$$b_i \\geq i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq m$$$).You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers, and you are asked $$$q$$$ queries. In each query, you are given two integers $$$p$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p,x \\leq n$$$). You have to do $$$a_p := x$$$ (assign $$$x$$$ to $$$a_p$$$). In the updated array, find the number of pairs of indices $$$(l, r)$$$, where $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, such that the array $$$[a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r]$$$ is good.Note that all queries are independent, which means after each query, the initial array $$$a$$$ is restored. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$). The third line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$p_j$$$ and $$$x_j$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_j, x_j \\leq n$$$) \u2013 the description of the $$$j$$$-th query.\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print the number of suitable pairs of indices after making the change. \n\nNotes: NoteHere are notes for first example.In first query, after update $$$a=[2,4,1,4]$$$. Now $$$(1,1)$$$, $$$(2,2)$$$, $$$(3,3)$$$, $$$(4,4)$$$, $$$(1,2)$$$, and $$$(3,4)$$$ are suitable pairs.In second query, after update $$$a=[2,4,3,4]$$$. Now all subarrays of $$$a$$$ are good.In third query, after update $$$a=[2,1,1,4]$$$. Now $$$(1,1)$$$, $$$(2,2)$$$, $$$(3,3)$$$, $$$(4,4)$$$, and $$$(3,4)$$$ are suitable.\n\nCode:\n\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\r\nfrom collections import defaultdict\r\n\r\nn = int(stdin.readline())\r\na = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]\r\n\r\nleft = 0\r\nright = 0\r\nright_array = []\r\nright_prefix = [0]\r\nanswer = 0\r\n\r\nsecond_right = 0\r\nsecond_right_array = []\r\nsecond_right_prefix = [0]\r\n\r\nwhile left < n:\r\n    if right < left:\r\n        right = left\r\n    while right < n and a[right] >= right-left+1:\r\n        right += 1\r\n    right_array.append(right)\r\n    right_prefix.append(right_prefix[-1]+right_array[-1])\r\n    answer += right -

Your job is to make sure all client issues have been resolved.Today you need to check a copy of a dialog between a client and a technical support manager. According to the rules of work, each message of the client must be followed by one or several messages, which are the answer of a support manager. However, sometimes clients ask questions so quickly that some of the manager's answers to old questions appear after the client has asked some new questions.Due to the privacy policy, the full text of messages is not available to you, only the order of messages is visible, as well as the type of each message: a customer question or a response from the technical support manager.

Do the operation with $$$(0,1)$$$. Now the state of the grid is $$$(1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,2,1)$$$.  Do the operation with $$$(1,0)$$$. Now the state of the grid is $$$(1,1,2),(0,2,1),(2,0,1)$$$.  Do the operation with $$$(1,1)$$$. Now the state of the grid is $$$(1,1,1),(0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,1),(2,1,1)$$$.  Do the operation with $$$(1,1)$$$. Now the state of the grid is $$$(0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,2),(2,1,2)$$$. Now all white cells contain $$$0$$$ dolls, so we have achieved the goal with $$$5$$$ operations.\n\nCode:\n\nn,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\r\nfor i in range(1,9**6): f.append(f[-1]*i%m)\r\nfor # TODO: Your code here\r\n    d+=f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],m-2,m)*(z!=0)\r\n    x+=1\r\nprint(d%m)", "eval_prompt": "n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\r\nfor i in range(1,9**6): f.append(f[-1]*i%m)\r\nfor {{completion}}\r\n    d+=f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],m-2,m)*(z!=0)\r\n    x+=1\r\nprint(d%m)", "ground_truth": "z in list(map(int,input().split())):", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"2\\n2 2 0\", \"output\": [\"5\"]}, {\"input\": \"10\\n12 11 8 8 6 6 6 5 3 2 1\", \"output\": [\"2596\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_007313", "full_ground_truth": "n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\r\nfor i in range(1,9**6): f.append(f[-1]*i%m)\r\nfor z in list(map(int,input().split())):\r\n    d+=f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],m-2,m)*(z!=0)\r\n    x+=1\r\nprint(d%m)"}
{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Mainak has a convex polygon $$$\\mathcal P$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices labelled as $$$A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$$$ in a counter-clockwise fashion. The coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point $$$A_i$$$ are given by $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$, where $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are both integers.Further, it is known that the interior angle at $$$A_i$$$ is either a right angle or a proper obtuse angle. Formally it is known that:   $$$90 ^ \\circ \\le \\angle A_{i - 1}A_{i}A_{i + 1} &lt; 180 ^ \\circ$$$, $$$\\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$ where we conventionally consider $$$A_0 = A_n$$$ and $$$A_{n + 1} = A_1$$$. Mainak's friend insisted that all points $$$Q$$$ such that there exists a chord of the polygon $$$\\mathcal P$$$ passing through $$$Q$$$ with length not exceeding $$$1$$$, must be coloured $$$\\color{red}{\\text{red}}$$$. Mainak wants you to find the area of the coloured region formed by the $$$\\color{red}{\\text{red}}$$$ points.Formally, determine the area of the region $$$\\mathcal S = \\{Q \\in \\mathcal{P}$$$ | $$$Q \\text{ is coloured } \\color{red}{\\text{red}}\\}$$$.Recall that a chord of a polygon is a line segment between two points lying on the boundary (i.e. vertices or points on edges) of the polygon. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) \u2014 the number of vertices of a polygon $$$\\mathcal P$$$. The $$$i$$$-th line of the next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the coordinates of $$$A_i$$$. Additional constraint on the input: The vertices form a convex polygon and are listed in counter-clockwise order. It is also guaranteed that all interior angles are in the range $$$[90^\\circ ; 180^\\circ )$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print the area of the region coloured in $$$\\color{red}{\\text{red}}$$$. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-4}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\\frac{|a - b|}{\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\le 10^{-4}$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example, the polygon $$$\\mathcal P$$$ can be visualised on the Cartesian Plane as:  \n\nCode:\n\nimport math\r\n\r\npi = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510\r\neps, sq2 = 1e-13, math.sqrt(2)\r\nx, y = [], []\r\nn = 0\r\n\r\n\r\ndef binary_find(la, lb, ra, rb, cy, fy, alpha_1, alpha_2, ab):\r\n    while math.fabs(cy -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Mainak has a convex polygon $$$\\mathcal P$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices labelled as $$$A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$$$ in a counter-clockwise fashion. The coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th point $$$A_i$$$ are given by $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$, where $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are both integers.Further, it is known that the interior angle at $$$A_i$$$ is either a right angle or a proper obtuse angle. Formally it is known that:   $$$90 ^ \\circ \\le \\angle A_{i - 1}A_{i}A_{i + 1} &lt; 180 ^ \\circ$$$, $$$\\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$ where we conventionally consider $$$A_0 = A_n$$$ and $$$A_{n + 1} = A_1$$$. Mainak's friend insisted that all points $$$Q$$$ such that there exists a chord of the polygon $$$\\mathcal P$$$ passing through $$$Q$$$ with length not exceeding $$$1$$$, must be coloured $$$\\color{red}{\\text{red}}$$$. Mainak wants you to find the area of the coloured region formed by the $$$\\color{red}{\\text{red}}$$$ points.Formally, determine the area of the region $$$\\mathcal S = \\{Q \\in \\mathcal{P}$$$ | $$$Q \\text{ is coloured } \\color{red}{\\text{red}}\\}$$$.Recall that a chord of a polygon is a line segment between two points lying on the boundary (i.e. vertices or points on edges) of the polygon. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) \u2014 the number of vertices of a polygon $$$\\mathcal P$$$. The $$$i$$$-th line of the next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the coordinates of $$$A_i$$$. Additional constraint on the input: The vertices form a convex polygon and are listed in counter-clockwise order. It is also guaranteed that all interior angles are in the range $$$[90^\\circ ; 180^\\circ )$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Print the area of the region coloured in $$$\\color{red}{\\text{red}}$$$. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-4}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\\frac{|a - b|}{\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\le 10^{-4}$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first example, the polygon $$$\\mathcal P$$$ can be visualised on the Cartesian Plane as:  \n\nCode:\n\nimport math\r\n\r\npi = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510\r\neps, sq2 = 1e-13, math.sqrt(2)\r\nx, y = [], []\r\nn = 0\r\n\r\n\r\ndef binary_find(la, lb, ra, rb, cy, fy, alpha_1, alpha_2, ab):\r\n    while math.fabs(cy -

Thus, the maximum size is $$$1$$$.In the third example, you can remove edges $$$(7, 1)$$$, $$$(2, 4)$$$, $$$(1, 3)$$$ and $$$(6, 2)$$$. The maximum cute set will be $$$S = \\{7, 3, 2\\}$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: There is a grid with $$$r$$$ rows and $$$c$$$ columns, where the square on the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column has an integer $$$a_{i, j}$$$ written on it. Initially, all elements are set to $$$0$$$. We are allowed to do the following operation:  Choose indices $$$1 \\le i \\le r$$$ and $$$1 \\le j \\le c$$$, then replace all values on the same row or column as $$$(i, j)$$$ with the value xor $$$1$$$. In other words, for all $$$a_{x, y}$$$ where $$$x=i$$$ or $$$y=j$$$ or both, replace $$$a_{x, y}$$$ with $$$a_{x, y}$$$ xor $$$1$$$. You want to form grid $$$b$$$ by doing the above operations a finite number of times. However, some elements of $$$b$$$ are missing and are replaced with '?' instead.Let $$$k$$$ be the number of '?' characters. Among all the $$$2^k$$$ ways of filling up the grid $$$b$$$ by replacing each '?' with '0' or '1', count the number of grids, that can be formed by doing the above operation a finite number of times, starting from the grid filled with $$$0$$$.

After that, $$$s$$$ is considered good if the lengths of all subsegments are even.For example, if $$$s$$$ is \"11001111\", it will be divided into \"11\", \"00\" and \"1111\". Their lengths are $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ respectively, which are all even numbers, so \"11001111\" is good.

Another example, if $$$s$$$ is \"1110011000\", it will be divided into \"111\", \"00\", \"11\" and \"000\", and their lengths are $$$3$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$. Obviously, \"1110011000\" is not good.Tokitsukaze wants to make $$$s$$$ good by changing the values of some positions in $$$s$$$. Specifically, she can perform the operation any number of times: change the value of $$$s_i$$$ to '0' or '1'($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$). Can you tell her the minimum number of operations to make $$$s$$$ good?\n\nInput Specification: The first contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of $$$s$$$, it is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is even. The second line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of zeros and ones. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case, print a single line with one integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of operations to make $$$s$$$ good.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first test case, one of the ways to make $$$s$$$ good is the following.Change $$$s_3$$$, $$$s_6$$$ and $$$s_7$$$ to '0', after that $$$s$$$ becomes \"1100000000\", it can be divided into \"11\" and \"00000000\", which lengths are $$$2$$$ and $$$8$$$ respectively. There are other ways to operate $$$3$$$ times to make $$$s$$$ good, such as \"1111110000\", \"1100001100\", \"1111001100\".In the second, third and fourth test cases, $$$s$$$ is good initially, so no operation is required.\n\nCode:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\r\n\tn,s,w=int(input()),input(),0\r\n\tprint(sum([1 for i in range(1,n,2) if s[i]!=s[i-1]]))", "eval_prompt": "for {{completion}}\r\n\tn,s,w=int(input()),input(),0\r\n\tprint(sum([1 for i in range(1,n,2) if s[i]!=s[i-1]]))", "ground_truth": "_ in range(int(input())):", "unit_tests": "[{\"input\": \"5\\n10\\n1110011000\\n8\\n11001111\\n2\\n00\\n2\\n11\\n6\\n100110\", \"output\": [\"3\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n3\"]}]", "task_id": "control_completion_007984", "full_ground_truth": "for _ in range(int(input())):\r\n\tn,s,w=int(input()),input(),0\r\n\tprint(sum([1 for i in range(1,n,2) if s[i]!=s[i-1]]))"}

In the $$$i$$$-th query, you will be given an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le n-1$$$). To process the query, you should do the following:  for every $$$i \\in [1, 2^n-2^k]$$$ in ascending order, do the following: if the $$$i$$$-th element was already swapped with some other element during this query, skip it; otherwise, swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+2^k}$$$;  after that, print the maximum sum over all contiguous subsegments of the array (including the empty subsegment). For example, if the array $$$a$$$ is $$$[-3, 5, -3, 2, 8, -20, 6, -1]$$$, and $$$k = 1$$$, the query is processed as follows:  the $$$1$$$-st element wasn't swapped yet, so we swap it with the $$$3$$$-rd element;  the $$$2$$$-nd element wasn't swapped yet, so we swap it with the $$$4$$$-th element;  the $$$3$$$-rd element was swapped already;  the $$$4$$$-th element was swapped already;  the $$$5$$$-th element wasn't swapped yet, so we swap it with the $$$7$$$-th element;  the $$$6$$$-th element wasn't swapped yet, so we swap it with the $$$8$$$-th element.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Polycarp has a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.He encodes it using the following algorithm.He goes through the letters of the string $$$s$$$ from left to right and for each letter Polycarp considers its number in the alphabet:  if the letter number is single-digit number (less than $$$10$$$), then just writes it out;  if the letter number is a two-digit number (greater than or equal to $$$10$$$), then it writes it out and adds the number 0 after. For example, if the string $$$s$$$ is code, then Polycarp will encode this string as follows:  'c'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$3$$$-rd letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds 3 to the code (the code becomes equal to 3);  'o'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$15$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds 15 to the code and also 0 (the code becomes 3150);  'd'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$4$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds 4 to the code (the code becomes 31504);  'e'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$5$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Therefore, Polycarp adds 5 to the code (the code becomes 315045). Thus, code of string code is 315045.You are given a string $$$t$$$ resulting from encoding the string $$$s$$$. Your task is to decode it (get the original string $$$s$$$ by $$$t$$$).\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of description of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) \u2014 the length of the given code. The second line of the description of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ \u2014 the given code. It is guaranteed that there exists such a string of lowercase Latin letters, as a result of encoding which the string $$$t$$$ is obtained.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case output the required string $$$s$$$ \u2014 the string that gives string $$$t$$$ as the result of encoding. It is guaranteed that such a string always exists. It can be shown that such a string is always unique.\n\nNotes: NoteThe first test case is explained above.In the second test case, the answer is aj. Indeed, the number of the letter a is equal to $$$1$$$, so 1 will be appended to the code. The number of the letter j is $$$10$$$, so 100 will be appended to the code. The resulting code is 1100.There are no zeros in the third test case, which means that the numbers of all letters are less than $$$10$$$ and are encoded as one digit. The original string is abacaba.In the fourth test case, the string $$$s$$$ is equal to ll. The letter l has the number $$$12$$$ and is encoded as 120.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Polycarp has a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.He encodes it using the following algorithm.He goes through the letters of the string $$$s$$$ from left to right and for each letter Polycarp considers its number in the alphabet:  if the letter number is single-digit number (less than $$$10$$$), then just writes it out;  if the letter number is a two-digit number (greater than or equal to $$$10$$$), then it writes it out and adds the number 0 after. For example, if the string $$$s$$$ is code, then Polycarp will encode this string as follows:  'c'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$3$$$-rd letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds 3 to the code (the code becomes equal to 3);  'o'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$15$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds 15 to the code and also 0 (the code becomes 3150);  'd'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$4$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds 4 to the code (the code becomes 31504);  'e'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$5$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Therefore, Polycarp adds 5 to the code (the code becomes 315045). Thus, code of string code is 315045.You are given a string $$$t$$$ resulting from encoding the string $$$s$$$. Your task is to decode it (get the original string $$$s$$$ by $$$t$$$).\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.

The second line of the description of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ \u2014 the given code. It is guaranteed that there exists such a string of lowercase Latin letters, as a result of encoding which the string $$$t$$$ is obtained.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case output the required string $$$s$$$ \u2014 the string that gives string $$$t$$$ as the result of encoding. It is guaranteed that such a string always exists. It can be shown that such a string is always unique.\n\nNotes: NoteThe first test case is explained above.In the second test case, the answer is aj. Indeed, the number of the letter a is equal to $$$1$$$, so 1 will be appended to the code. The number of the letter j is $$$10$$$, so 100 will be appended to the code. The resulting code is 1100.There are no zeros in the third test case, which means that the numbers of all letters are less than $$$10$$$ and are encoded as one digit. The original string is abacaba.In the fourth test case, the string $$$s$$$ is equal to ll. The letter l has the number $$$12$$$ and is encoded as 120.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You are given two non-empty strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, consisting of Latin letters.In one move, you can choose an occurrence of the string $$$t$$$ in the string $$$s$$$ and replace it with dots.Your task is to remove all occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ in the string $$$s$$$ in the minimum number of moves, and also calculate how many different sequences of moves of the minimum length exist.Two sequences of moves are considered different if the sets of indices at which the removed occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ in $$$s$$$ begin differ. For example, the sets $$$\\{1, 2, 3\\}$$$ and $$$\\{1, 2, 4\\}$$$ are considered different, the sets $$$\\{2, 4, 6\\}$$$ and $$$\\{2, 6\\}$$$ \u2014 too, but sets $$$\\{3, 5\\}$$$ and $$$\\{5, 3\\}$$$ \u2014 not.For example, let the string $$$s =$$$ \"abababacababa\" and the string $$$t =$$$ \"aba\". We can remove all occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ in $$$2$$$ moves by cutting out the occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ at the $$$3$$$th and $$$9$$$th positions. In this case, the string $$$s$$$ is an example of the form \"ab...bac...ba\". It is also possible to cut occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ at the $$$3$$$th and $$$11$$$th positions. There are two different sequences of minimum length moves.Since the answer can be large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 50$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the sets follow. The first line of each set contains a non-empty string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 500$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The second line of each set contains a non-empty string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le |t| \\le 500$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You are given two non-empty strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, consisting of Latin letters.In one move, you can choose an occurrence of the string $$$t$$$ in the string $$$s$$$ and replace it with dots.Your task is to remove all occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ in the string $$$s$$$ in the minimum number of moves, and also calculate how many different sequences of moves of the minimum length exist.Two sequences of moves are considered different if the sets of indices at which the removed occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ in $$$s$$$ begin differ. For example, the sets $$$\\{1, 2, 3\\}$$$ and $$$\\{1, 2, 4\\}$$$ are considered different, the sets $$$\\{2, 4, 6\\}$$$ and $$$\\{2, 6\\}$$$ \u2014 too, but sets $$$\\{3, 5\\}$$$ and $$$\\{5, 3\\}$$$ \u2014 not.For example, let the string $$$s =$$$ \"abababacababa\" and the string $$$t =$$$ \"aba\". We can remove all occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ in $$$2$$$ moves by cutting out the occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ at the $$$3$$$th and $$$9$$$th positions. In this case, the string $$$s$$$ is an example of the form \"ab...bac...ba\". It is also possible to cut occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ at the $$$3$$$th and $$$11$$$th positions. There are two different sequences of minimum length moves.Since the answer can be large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 50$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.

The second line of each set contains a non-empty string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le |t| \\le 500$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$. Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths $$$t$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case print two integers \u2014 the minimum number of moves and the number of different optimal sequences, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteThe first test case is explained in the statement.In the second case, it is enough to cut any of the four occurrences.In the third case, string $$$s$$$ is the concatenation of two strings $$$t =$$$ \"xyz\", so there is a unique optimal sequence of $$$2$$$ moves.In the fourth and sixth cases, the string $$$s$$$ initially contains no occurrences of the string $$$t$$$.In the fifth case, the string $$$s$$$ contains exactly one occurrence of the string $$$t$$$.\n\nCode:\n\n# from __future__ import annotations\n\nimport csv\nimport datetime\nimport string\nimport sys\nimport time\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\n\ndef solve() -> None:\n  s = next_token()\n  t = next_token()\n  ls = len(s)\n  lt = len(t)\n  is_start = [s[i:i + lt] == t for i in range(ls)]\n  d: List[List[Optional[List[int]]]] = [[None for _ in range(j + 1)] for j in range(ls)]\n  for ln in range(1, ls + 1):\n    for j in range(ln -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You are given two non-empty strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, consisting of Latin letters.In one move, you can choose an occurrence of the string $$$t$$$ in the string $$$s$$$ and replace it with dots.Your task is to remove all occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ in the string $$$s$$$ in the minimum number of moves, and also calculate how many different sequences of moves of the minimum length exist.Two sequences of moves are considered different if the sets of indices at which the removed occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ in $$$s$$$ begin differ. For example, the sets $$$\\{1, 2, 3\\}$$$ and $$$\\{1, 2, 4\\}$$$ are considered different, the sets $$$\\{2, 4, 6\\}$$$ and $$$\\{2, 6\\}$$$ \u2014 too, but sets $$$\\{3, 5\\}$$$ and $$$\\{5, 3\\}$$$ \u2014 not.For example, let the string $$$s =$$$ \"abababacababa\" and the string $$$t =$$$ \"aba\". We can remove all occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ in $$$2$$$ moves by cutting out the occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ at the $$$3$$$th and $$$9$$$th positions. In this case, the string $$$s$$$ is an example of the form \"ab...bac...ba\". It is also possible to cut occurrences of the string $$$t$$$ at the $$$3$$$th and $$$11$$$th positions. There are two different sequences of minimum length moves.Since the answer can be large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 50$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the sets follow. The first line of each set contains a non-empty string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 500$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The second line of each set contains a non-empty string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le |t| \\le 500$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$. Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths $$$t$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case print two integers \u2014 the minimum number of moves and the number of different optimal sequences, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\nNotes: NoteThe first test case is explained in the statement.In the second case, it is enough to cut any of the four occurrences.In the third case, string $$$s$$$ is the concatenation of two strings $$$t =$$$ \"xyz\", so there is a unique optimal sequence of $$$2$$$ moves.In the fourth and sixth cases, the string $$$s$$$ initially contains no occurrences of the string $$$t$$$.In the fifth case, the string $$$s$$$ contains exactly one occurrence of the string $$$t$$$.\n\nCode:\n\n# from __future__ import annotations\n\nimport csv\nimport datetime\nimport string\nimport sys\nimport time\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\n\ndef solve() -> None:\n  s = next_token()\n  t = next_token()\n  ls = len(s)\n  lt = len(t)\n  is_start = [s[i:i + lt] == t for i in range(ls)]\n  d: List[List[Optional[List[int]]]] = [[None for _ in range(j + 1)] for j in range(ls)]\n  for ln in range(1, ls + 1):\n    for j in range(ln -

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Given the string $$$s$$$ of decimal digits (0-9) of length $$$n$$$.A substring is a sequence of consecutive characters of a string. The substring of this string is defined by a pair of indexes \u2014 with its left and right ends. So, each pair of indexes ($$$l, r$$$), where $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, corresponds to a substring of the string $$$s$$$. We will define as $$$v(l,r)$$$ the numeric value of the corresponding substring (leading zeros are allowed in it).For example, if $$$n=7$$$, $$$s=$$$\"1003004\", then $$$v(1,3)=100$$$, $$$v(2,3)=0$$$ and $$$v(2,7)=3004$$$.You are given $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$ and an integer $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\le w &lt; n$$$).You need to process $$$m$$$ queries, each of which is characterized by $$$3$$$ numbers $$$l_i, r_i, k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n; 0 \\le k_i \\le 8$$$).The answer to the $$$i$$$th query is such a pair of substrings of length $$$w$$$ that if we denote them as $$$(L_1, L_1+w-1)$$$ and $$$(L_2, L_2+w-1)$$$, then:  $$$L_1 \\ne L_2$$$, that is, the substrings are different;  the remainder of dividing a number $$$v(L_1, L_1+w-1) \\cdot v(l_i, r_i) + v(L_2, L_2 + w - 1)$$$ by $$$9$$$ is equal to $$$k_i$$$. If there are many matching substring pairs, then find a pair where $$$L_1$$$ is as small as possible. If there are many matching pairs in this case, then minimize $$$L_2$$$.Note that the answer may not exist.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 number of input test cases. The first line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$, which contains only the characters 0-9 and has a length $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains two integers $$$w, m$$$ ($$$1 \\le w &lt; n, 1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$n$$$ \u2014 is the length of the given string $$$s$$$. The number $$$w$$$ denotes the lengths of the substrings being searched for, and $$$m$$$ is the number of queries to be processed. The following $$$m$$$ lines contain integers $$$l_i, r_i, k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$, $$$0 \\le k_i \\le 8$$$)\u00a0\u2014 $$$i$$$th query parameters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each request, print in a separate line:    left borders of the required substrings: $$$L_1$$$ and $$$L_2$$$; -1 -1 otherwise, if there is no solution.  If there are several solutions, minimize $$$L_1$$$ first, and minimize $$$L_2$$$ second.\n\nNotes: NoteConsider the first test case of example inputs. In this test case $$$n=7$$$, $$$s=$$$\"1003004\", $$$w=4$$$ and one query $$$l_1=1$$$, $$$r_1=2$$$, $$$k_1=1$$$. Note that $$$v(1,2)=10$$$. We need to find a pair of substrings of length $$$4$$$ such that $$$v(L_1, L_1+3)\\cdot10+v(L_2,L_2+3)$$$ has a remainder of $$$k_1=1$$$ when divided by $$$9$$$. The values $$$L_1=2, L_2=4$$$ actually satisfy all the requirements: $$$v(L_1, L_1+w-1)=v(2,5)=30$$$, $$$v(L_2, L_2+w-1)=v(4,7)=3004$$$. Indeed, $$$30\\cdot10+3004=3304$$$, which has a remainder of $$$1$$$ when divided by $$$9$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Given the string $$$s$$$ of decimal digits (0-9) of length $$$n$$$.A substring is a sequence of consecutive characters of a string. The substring of this string is defined by a pair of indexes \u2014 with its left and right ends. So, each pair of indexes ($$$l, r$$$), where $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, corresponds to a substring of the string $$$s$$$. We will define as $$$v(l,r)$$$ the numeric value of the corresponding substring (leading zeros are allowed in it).For example, if $$$n=7$$$, $$$s=$$$\"1003004\", then $$$v(1,3)=100$$$, $$$v(2,3)=0$$$ and $$$v(2,7)=3004$$$.You are given $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$ and an integer $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\le w &lt; n$$$).You need to process $$$m$$$ queries, each of which is characterized by $$$3$$$ numbers $$$l_i, r_i, k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n; 0 \\le k_i \\le 8$$$).The answer to the $$$i$$$th query is such a pair of substrings of length $$$w$$$ that if we denote them as $$$(L_1, L_1+w-1)$$$ and $$$(L_2, L_2+w-1)$$$, then:  $$$L_1 \\ne L_2$$$, that is, the substrings are different;  the remainder of dividing a number $$$v(L_1, L_1+w-1) \\cdot v(l_i, r_i) + v(L_2, L_2 + w - 1)$$$ by $$$9$$$ is equal to $$$k_i$$$. If there are many matching substring pairs, then find a pair where $$$L_1$$$ is as small as possible. If there are many matching pairs in this case, then minimize $$$L_2$$$.Note that the answer may not exist.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 number of input test cases. The first line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$, which contains only the characters 0-9 and has a length $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains two integers $$$w, m$$$ ($$$1 \\le w &lt; n, 1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$n$$$ \u2014 is the length of the given string $$$s$$$. The number $$$w$$$ denotes the lengths of the substrings being searched for, and $$$m$$$ is the number of queries to be processed. The following $$$m$$$ lines contain integers $$$l_i, r_i, k_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$, $$$0 \\le k_i \\le 8$$$)\u00a0\u2014 $$$i$$$th query parameters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each request, print in a separate line:    left borders of the required substrings: $$$L_1$$$ and $$$L_2$$$; -1 -1 otherwise, if there is no solution.  If there are several solutions, minimize $$$L_1$$$ first, and minimize $$$L_2$$$ second.\n\nNotes: NoteConsider the first test case of example inputs. In this test case $$$n=7$$$, $$$s=$$$\"1003004\", $$$w=4$$$ and one query $$$l_1=1$$$, $$$r_1=2$$$, $$$k_1=1$$$. Note that $$$v(1,2)=10$$$. We need to find a pair of substrings of length $$$4$$$ such that $$$v(L_1, L_1+3)\\cdot10+v(L_2,L_2+3)$$$ has a remainder of $$$k_1=1$$$ when divided by $$$9$$$. The values $$$L_1=2, L_2=4$$$ actually satisfy all the requirements: $$$v(L_1, L_1+w-1)=v(2,5)=30$$$, $$$v(L_2, L_2+w-1)=v(4,7)=3004$$$. Indeed, $$$30\\cdot10+3004=3304$$$, which has a remainder of $$$1$$$ when divided by $$$9$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: You are an ambitious king who wants to be the Emperor of The Reals. But to do that, you must first become Emperor of The Integers.Consider a number axis. The capital of your empire is initially at $$$0$$$. There are $$$n$$$ unconquered kingdoms at positions $$$0&lt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;\\ldots&lt;x_n$$$. You want to conquer all other kingdoms.There are two actions available to you:   You can change the location of your capital (let its current position be $$$c_1$$$) to any other conquered kingdom (let its position be $$$c_2$$$) at a cost of $$$a\\cdot |c_1-c_2|$$$.  From the current capital (let its current position be $$$c_1$$$) you can conquer an unconquered kingdom (let its position be $$$c_2$$$) at a cost of $$$b\\cdot |c_1-c_2|$$$. You cannot conquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom between the target and your capital. Note that you cannot place the capital at a point without a kingdom. In other words, at any point, your capital can only be at $$$0$$$ or one of $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$$$. Also note that conquering a kingdom does not change the position of your capital.Find the minimum total cost to conquer all kingdoms. Your capital can be anywhere at the end.\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows. The first line of each test case contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \\ldots &lt; x_n \\leq 10^8$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case, output a single integer \u00a0\u2014 the minimum cost to conquer all kingdoms.\n\nNotes: NoteHere is an optimal sequence of moves for the second test case:  Conquer the kingdom at position $$$1$$$ with cost $$$3\\cdot(1-0)=3$$$.  Move the capital to the kingdom at position $$$1$$$ with cost $$$6\\cdot(1-0)=6$$$.  Conquer the kingdom at position $$$5$$$ with cost $$$3\\cdot(5-1)=12$$$.  Move the capital to the kingdom at position $$$5$$$ with cost $$$6\\cdot(5-1)=24$$$.  Conquer the kingdom at position $$$6$$$ with cost $$$3\\cdot(6-5)=3$$$.

But to do that, you must first become Emperor of The Integers.Consider a number axis. The capital of your empire is initially at $$$0$$$. There are $$$n$$$ unconquered kingdoms at positions $$$0&lt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;\\ldots&lt;x_n$$$. You want to conquer all other kingdoms.There are two actions available to you:   You can change the location of your capital (let its current position be $$$c_1$$$) to any other conquered kingdom (let its position be $$$c_2$$$) at a cost of $$$a\\cdot |c_1-c_2|$$$.  From the current capital (let its current position be $$$c_1$$$) you can conquer an unconquered kingdom (let its position be $$$c_2$$$) at a cost of $$$b\\cdot |c_1-c_2|$$$. You cannot conquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom between the target and your capital. Note that you cannot place the capital at a point without a kingdom. In other words, at any point, your capital can only be at $$$0$$$ or one of $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$$$. Also note that conquering a kingdom does not change the position of your capital.Find the minimum total cost to conquer all kingdoms.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: There is an undirected, connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ weighted edges. A walk from vertex $$$u$$$ to vertex $$$v$$$ is defined as a sequence of vertices $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$$$ (which are not necessarily distinct) starting with $$$u$$$ and ending with $$$v$$$, such that $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$ are connected by an edge for $$$1 \\leq i &lt; k$$$.We define the length of a walk as follows: take the ordered sequence of edges and write down the weights on each of them in an array. Now, write down the bitwise AND of every nonempty prefix of this array. The length of the walk is the MEX of all these values.More formally, let us have $$$[w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_{k-1}]$$$ where $$$w_i$$$ is the weight of the edge between $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$. Then the length of the walk is given by $$$\\mathrm{MEX}(\\{w_1,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2\\&amp; \\ldots\\&amp; w_{k-1}\\})$$$, where $$$\\&amp;$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.Now you must process $$$q$$$ queries of the form u v. For each query, find the minimum possible length of a walk from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.The MEX (minimum excluded) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the set. For instance:   The MEX of $$$\\{2,1\\}$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the set.  The MEX of $$$\\{3,1,0\\}$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the set, but $$$2$$$ does not.  The MEX of $$$\\{0,3,1,2\\}$$$ is $$$4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the set, but $$$4$$$ does not. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$; $$$n-1 \\leq m \\leq \\min{\\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},10^5\\right)}$$$). Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\neq b$$$; $$$0 \\leq w &lt; 2^{30}$$$) indicating an undirected edge between vertex $$$a$$$ and vertex $$$b$$$ with weight $$$w$$$. The input will not contain self-loops or duplicate edges, and the provided graph will be connected. The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$).

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: There is an undirected, connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ weighted edges. A walk from vertex $$$u$$$ to vertex $$$v$$$ is defined as a sequence of vertices $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$$$ (which are not necessarily distinct) starting with $$$u$$$ and ending with $$$v$$$, such that $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$ are connected by an edge for $$$1 \\leq i &lt; k$$$.We define the length of a walk as follows: take the ordered sequence of edges and write down the weights on each of them in an array. Now, write down the bitwise AND of every nonempty prefix of this array. The length of the walk is the MEX of all these values.More formally, let us have $$$[w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_{k-1}]$$$ where $$$w_i$$$ is the weight of the edge between $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$. Then the length of the walk is given by $$$\\mathrm{MEX}(\\{w_1,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2\\&amp; \\ldots\\&amp; w_{k-1}\\})$$$, where $$$\\&amp;$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.Now you must process $$$q$$$ queries of the form u v. For each query, find the minimum possible length of a walk from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.The MEX (minimum excluded) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the set. For instance:   The MEX of $$$\\{2,1\\}$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the set.  The MEX of $$$\\{3,1,0\\}$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the set, but $$$2$$$ does not.  The MEX of $$$\\{0,3,1,2\\}$$$ is $$$4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the set, but $$$4$$$ does not. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$; $$$n-1 \\leq m \\leq \\min{\\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},10^5\\right)}$$$). Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\neq b$$$; $$$0 \\leq w &lt; 2^{30}$$$) indicating an undirected edge between vertex $$$a$$$ and vertex $$$b$$$ with weight $$$w$$$. The input will not contain self-loops or duplicate edges, and the provided graph will be connected. The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$), the description of each query.\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print one line containing a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the answer to the query.\n\nNotes: NoteThe following is an explanation of the first example.    The graph in the first example. Here is one possible walk for the first query:$$$$$$1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{3}{\\rightarrow} 2 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 4 \\overset{2}{\\rightarrow} 5.$$$$$$The array of weights is $$$w=[5,3,1,5,1,2]$$$.

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: There is an undirected, connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ weighted edges. A walk from vertex $$$u$$$ to vertex $$$v$$$ is defined as a sequence of vertices $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$$$ (which are not necessarily distinct) starting with $$$u$$$ and ending with $$$v$$$, such that $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$ are connected by an edge for $$$1 \\leq i &lt; k$$$.We define the length of a walk as follows: take the ordered sequence of edges and write down the weights on each of them in an array. Now, write down the bitwise AND of every nonempty prefix of this array. The length of the walk is the MEX of all these values.More formally, let us have $$$[w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_{k-1}]$$$ where $$$w_i$$$ is the weight of the edge between $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$. Then the length of the walk is given by $$$\\mathrm{MEX}(\\{w_1,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2\\&amp; \\ldots\\&amp; w_{k-1}\\})$$$, where $$$\\&amp;$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.Now you must process $$$q$$$ queries of the form u v. For each query, find the minimum possible length of a walk from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.The MEX (minimum excluded) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the set. For instance:   The MEX of $$$\\{2,1\\}$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the set.  The MEX of $$$\\{3,1,0\\}$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the set, but $$$2$$$ does not.  The MEX of $$$\\{0,3,1,2\\}$$$ is $$$4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the set, but $$$4$$$ does not. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$; $$$n-1 \\leq m \\leq \\min{\\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},10^5\\right)}$$$). Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\neq b$$$; $$$0 \\leq w &lt; 2^{30}$$$) indicating an undirected edge between vertex $$$a$$$ and vertex $$$b$$$ with weight $$$w$$$. The input will not contain self-loops or duplicate edges, and the provided graph will be connected. The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$), the description of each query.\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print one line containing a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the answer to the query.\n\nNotes: NoteThe following is an explanation of the first example.    The graph in the first example. Here is one possible walk for the first query:$$$$$$1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{3}{\\rightarrow} 2 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 4 \\overset{2}{\\rightarrow} 5.$$$$$$The array of weights is $$$w=[5,3,1,5,1,2]$$$. Now if we take the bitwise AND of every prefix of this array, we get the set $$$\\{5,1,0\\}$$$. The MEX of this set is $$$2$$$. We cannot get a walk with a smaller length (as defined in the statement).\n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\n\r\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\r\n\r\ndef bit(w, b):\r\n    if w & (1 << b):\r\n        return 1\r\n

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: There is an undirected, connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ weighted edges. A walk from vertex $$$u$$$ to vertex $$$v$$$ is defined as a sequence of vertices $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$$$ (which are not necessarily distinct) starting with $$$u$$$ and ending with $$$v$$$, such that $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$ are connected by an edge for $$$1 \\leq i &lt; k$$$.We define the length of a walk as follows: take the ordered sequence of edges and write down the weights on each of them in an array. Now, write down the bitwise AND of every nonempty prefix of this array. The length of the walk is the MEX of all these values.More formally, let us have $$$[w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_{k-1}]$$$ where $$$w_i$$$ is the weight of the edge between $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$. Then the length of the walk is given by $$$\\mathrm{MEX}(\\{w_1,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2\\&amp; \\ldots\\&amp; w_{k-1}\\})$$$, where $$$\\&amp;$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.Now you must process $$$q$$$ queries of the form u v. For each query, find the minimum possible length of a walk from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.The MEX (minimum excluded) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the set. For instance:   The MEX of $$$\\{2,1\\}$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the set.  The MEX of $$$\\{3,1,0\\}$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the set, but $$$2$$$ does not.  The MEX of $$$\\{0,3,1,2\\}$$$ is $$$4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the set, but $$$4$$$ does not. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$; $$$n-1 \\leq m \\leq \\min{\\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},10^5\\right)}$$$). Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\neq b$$$; $$$0 \\leq w &lt; 2^{30}$$$) indicating an undirected edge between vertex $$$a$$$ and vertex $$$b$$$ with weight $$$w$$$. The input will not contain self-loops or duplicate edges, and the provided graph will be connected. The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$), the description of each query.\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print one line containing a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the answer to the query.\n\nNotes: NoteThe following is an explanation of the first example.    The graph in the first example. Here is one possible walk for the first query:$$$$$$1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{3}{\\rightarrow} 2 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 4 \\overset{2}{\\rightarrow} 5.$$$$$$The array of weights is $$$w=[5,3,1,5,1,2]$$$. Now if we take the bitwise AND of every prefix of this array, we get the set $$$\\{5,1,0\\}$$$. The MEX of this set is $$$2$$$. We cannot get a walk with a smaller length (as defined in the statement).\n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\r\n\r\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\r\n\r\ndef bit(w, b):\r\n    if w & (1 << b):\r\n        return 1\r\n

{"lang": "python", "prompt": "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: There is an undirected, connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ weighted edges. A walk from vertex $$$u$$$ to vertex $$$v$$$ is defined as a sequence of vertices $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$$$ (which are not necessarily distinct) starting with $$$u$$$ and ending with $$$v$$$, such that $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$ are connected by an edge for $$$1 \\leq i &lt; k$$$.We define the length of a walk as follows: take the ordered sequence of edges and write down the weights on each of them in an array. Now, write down the bitwise AND of every nonempty prefix of this array. The length of the walk is the MEX of all these values.More formally, let us have $$$[w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_{k-1}]$$$ where $$$w_i$$$ is the weight of the edge between $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$. Then the length of the walk is given by $$$\\mathrm{MEX}(\\{w_1,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,w_1\\&amp; w_2\\&amp; \\ldots\\&amp; w_{k-1}\\})$$$, where $$$\\&amp;$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.Now you must process $$$q$$$ queries of the form u v. For each query, find the minimum possible length of a walk from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.The MEX (minimum excluded) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the set. For instance:   The MEX of $$$\\{2,1\\}$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the set.  The MEX of $$$\\{3,1,0\\}$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the set, but $$$2$$$ does not.  The MEX of $$$\\{0,3,1,2\\}$$$ is $$$4$$$ because $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ belong to the set, but $$$4$$$ does not. \n\nInput Specification: The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$; $$$n-1 \\leq m \\leq \\min{\\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},10^5\\right)}$$$). Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\neq b$$$; $$$0 \\leq w &lt; 2^{30}$$$) indicating an undirected edge between vertex $$$a$$$ and vertex $$$b$$$ with weight $$$w$$$. The input will not contain self-loops or duplicate edges, and the provided graph will be connected. The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$). Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$), the description of each query.\n\nOutput Specification: For each query, print one line containing a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the answer to the query.\n\nNotes: NoteThe following is an explanation of the first example.    The graph in the first example. Here is one possible walk for the first query:$$$$$$1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{3}{\\rightarrow} 2 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 4 \\overset{2}{\\rightarrow} 5.$$$$$$The array of weights is $$$w=[5,3,1,5,1,2]$$$. Now if we take the bitwise AND of every prefix of this array, we get the set $$$\\{5,1,0\\}$$$. The MEX of this set is $$$2$$$. We cannot get a walk with a smaller length (as defined in the statement).\n\nCode:\n\nfrom sys import stdin\r\ninput = stdin.readline\r\n\r\ninp = lambda :

Here is one possible walk for the first query:$$$$$$1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{3}{\\rightarrow} 2 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 1 \\overset{5}{\\rightarrow} 3 \\overset{1}{\\rightarrow} 4 \\overset{2}{\\rightarrow} 5.$$$$$$The array of weights is $$$w=[5,3,1,5,1,2]$$$. Now if we take the bitwise AND of every prefix of this array, we get the set $$$\\{5,1,0\\}$$$. The MEX of this set is $$$2$$$. We cannot get a walk with a smaller length (as defined in the statement).\n\nCode:\n\nfrom sys import stdin\r\ninput = stdin.readline\r\n\r\ninp = lambda :
